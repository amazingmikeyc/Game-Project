I''d love to say it was a tale of non-stop wackiness, jolly thrills and good clean fun. And it was!\r\n\r\nI got on the train to Worcester where I sat next to a man who didn''t seem to understand that we were meant to share the double seat and kept moving his legs onto my half. If that wasn''t annoying enough, the staff at Birmingham New Street seemed to all enjoy contradicting themselves and telling me to go to the wrong platform. The second train then had an odd conductor who had a disconcerting habit of giving a thumbs up after checking your tickets. Weirdo. Unless he was giving a thumbs up to my photo on the railcard, in which case he''s got good taste.\r\n\r\nFinally I arrived at Worcester and was greeted by my friends and former housemates Guy and Paul. We had to walk to the car because they couldn''t be bothered to get it - which didn''t make much sense to me. Anyway, after some dinner at Guy''s house (it''s a nice little house; I''d be tempted to call it a cottage if it wasn''t so suburban) we went off to the pub for beer tasting and chat.\r\n\r\nA good way of telling if you''re good friends with someone is if after a year of not seeing them you can talk to them as if you saw them the day before. It was really nice to catch up with them and we discussed the difficulty of looking for work when you''ve not got any set ambitions and the merits of beer, plus some general misty-eyed reminiscing.\r\n\r\nSaturday I got a tour of Worcester. It''s a nice picturesque city, so it''s a shame I left my camera at Guy''s.\r\n\r\nWorcester Cathedral is an impressive structure and is 1100 years old or something. We spent about half an hour looking at the stained glass windows, the statues and the romanesque architecture. I had a glance at the post-its that people had put up with for prayer requests... some sad stuff up there. All in all, it gets a score of 500 Cathedral Points.\r\n\r\nI often whether the people who get buried in cathedrals realise that, however ornate and majestic their statue might be in 500 years time their lives will mean very little. Was being buried in a cathedral some kind of way of getting closer to God, and was it simply reserved for the rich? What kind of spiritual significance was attached to a cathedral? Our lives pass, but the cathedral stays standing. And if the cathedral represents God''s church, we have a nice little metaphor there. \r\n\r\nWith the tower pointing up to the heavens, and the main doors pointing towards Calvary they were built to evoke awe and wonder at God''s majesty; to make people see something of God. Yet today it''s really easy to think "wow, weren''t people clever at building pretty things in the olden days?" Er, yeah. Anyway...\r\n\r\nWe also walked down to the canal where they were having a Chinese dragon boat race with teams representing Hereford, Gloucester and Worcester. It''s a great annual tradition in Worcester, apparently, but nobody seems to know why. The announcer unhelpfully told everyone why it was a tradition in China, but failed to explain why its been picked up in the South West Midlands. Unless the Emperor of China was from Worcester, which I doubt. Much amusement was had by the fact that the deans of the cathedrals were sat in each boat banging a drum, which was very <em>Father Ted</em>.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we checked out the Worcester pubs and clubs and we got unwanted attention from some girls! I got bored and tried to start a conversation in the toilet to see what the reaction would be. I wasn''t beaten up, so it was probably OK. Guy got rid of the girls by saying that not only were he and Paul gay (which is true) but I was as well (which is untrue). That was uncalled for, especially since I think I''d already weirded them out by saying I started a conversation in the toilet. Perhaps next time I should talk about the Gospel - that would get rid of them.\r\n\r\n<em>Coming soon</em> - I walk up a hill, get on a train, walk up another hill, and complete my tri-county marathon.

('My Cathedral Tour PART TWO', 'On Sunday we took in the delights of the local Morrisons. The café food was tasty and there was a fine selection of groceries throughout the store. Paul''s driving was really scary so Guy drove us the rest of the way to Malvern which is famous for being near some hills.\r\n\r\nWe made a half-baked attempt to climb the hill and looked out at the not unattractive view. We could just about make out Worcester cathedral which was a good 20 miles away.\r\n\r\n<img src="/images/guyandpaul_malvern.jpg" class="illustrationcentre" />\r\n\r\nThere''s a little spring part way up where you can get fresh water where we rested for a time. As we sat there, we spotted a labrador that seemed to be amused about something but trying to hide it as if remembering a joke told to him by a recently deceased friend. The dog later did a really really stinky poo downwind of where we were sitting, so I suppose that was what he found so funny.\r\n\r\nPaul wanted to have haggis for tea, but however delicious it may be, I was forced to decline because <em>I know what it is</em>. Instead we had lasagne and it was tasty.\r\n\r\nNext day I went to Worcester station to head off to Gloucester to visit my friend Jon. Some of the journey was by coach because Central Trains are absolutely useless and don''t seem to be able to understand the difference. I got to Gloucester only 10 minutes later than advertised and caught a bus to the little town of Newent. \r\n\r\nI arrived and had to get the key off Jon''s brother Dan who was working in a bookshop near the bus stop. I reckon he looks a bit like the Edge from U2, but nobody seems to agree with me. Dan sent me a crazy long way round because he thought I''d come by car, so when I finally arrived at Jon''s I just wanted to sleep.\r\n\r\nSleep was not on the agenda however because following this was an ordeal where we went to Jon''s neighbours for a barbecue. It wasn''t really an ordeal - actually I enjoyed myself. Much wackiness ensued but I was too tired to enjoy it properly and instead was just confused and bemused.\r\n\r\nLater, I beat Jon at Scrabble by getting "Boxed" on a triple word score. Result!\r\n\r\nNext day Jon and me went on a magical mystery tour. We popped in to Hereford cathedral (only 400 Cathedral Points, I''m afraid - it''s just not shiny enough) and then drove off up a hill in Wales. We got stuck behind loads of tractors. However, when we got to the top, the view was stunning. I wonder why instead of building cathedrals they didn''t just walk up hills and look out. Would''ve been cheaper.\r\n\r\n<img src="/images/walesview.jpg"  class="illustrationcentre" />\r\n<img src="/images/jon_hill.jpg" class="illustrationcentre" />\r\n\r\nWe visited some bookshops in Hay-on-Wye and then went up another hill that I can''t remember the name of.\r\n\r\nLater, I lost at Scrabble badly.\r\n\r\nThe final day of my adventure I made my way back into Gloucester. I had a look at the cathedral - pretty good. The most attractive from the outside. I thought I saw someone I sort-of know as well, but I successfully avoided her because I couldn''t remember her name. Anyway, Gloucester cathedral gets 490 points, including compensation for what I call the "Harry Potter effect" (parts of it was filmed there).\r\n\r\nThen I got on the train.

('Education, Christians, you, me, everyone', 'In the Guardian today is an interesting article about the increasing number of evangelical schools in this country. I say interesting, but it didn''t tell me anything I didn''t already know (A fully "Christian" syllabus is a bad idea, and the Guardian thinks Christians are all loons) <a href="http://education.guardian.co.uk/faithschools/story/0,13882,1556168,00.html">Read it yourselves</a>. The article''s pretty much what you''d expect from a national newspaper - "neutral" except on bits that are actually true when they just go and slag it off.\r\n\r\nThe teachers in these schools are no doubt Godly men and women who are teaching the Bible faithfully, and I praise God for the work he''s doing through them - but I don''t support the idea. Well, I''m not against Christian schooling in theory... but in practice I have a number of misgivings.\r\n\r\nIt''s not for the reasons of "tolerance" and "acceptance" mentioned in the article (oh dear, I sound like a Daily Mail reader) but more that I fear they hide children from the harsh facts and the real battles going on. What''s going to happen when they come head-on against the opposing view? Are they going to crack? \r\n\r\nA quick glance at parts of the nuttier sections of the web can show you what happens when a hardcore Christian education goes wrong the other way - a complete lack of critical thinking where any question can be answered with a quick, cursory glance at the Bible.\r\n\r\nMany Christians are guilty of passing on rumour or misinterpretation as fact, particularly in the evolution debate, creating an impression that there are no difficult questions or grey-areas. The last thing we want is a generation of Christians who don''t understand the world at all.\r\n\r\nTell me I''m wrong, but I think we should pray about these schools that not only do they preach the Gospel & teach Christian living faithfully but that they also teach facts & encourage thinking skills so that they can create strong, intelligent thinking Christians.\r\n\r\nHey - I''ve just had a good idea for my blog.

('Intelligent Design Is Not Science', 'It''s not. At least, I don''t think it is.\r\n\r\nThere''s no way you can look at the design of something objectively and say with any credibility whether it was designed or not. Paley said you''d assume that a watch in the middle of the street was designed, but that''s because watches generally are. You''re making a sensible deduction based on experience. You can''t look at a frog and say the same thing because you''ve never seen someone design and build a frog.\r\n\r\nTo use the old saying - science tells us <em>how</em> but it cannot tell us <em>why</em>. It''s an equally silly thing to say that science can say that things happened purely by chance. The mistake made is that because they cannot use science to answer the why they assume that the answer must be "because it is." You can''t apply the Why to the How and assume that you can derive one from the other. \r\n\r\nThe problem with the Intelligent Design movement is that it''s pushing itself as science when really it''s a kind of philosophy. "Ah," you say, " but scary super-Darwinists like Dawkins often push their philosophy with science, so why can''t we?" - because it''s not science! Christian scientists (with a small ''s'') can''t go around accusing atheists of pushing a non-scientific agenda when they are doing the exact same thing. \r\n\r\nFor an example, a leading Creationist web site seem to spend half their articles making <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem">ad hominem</a> arguments ("Hitler was an atheist!") while accusing others of doing the same thing. \r\n\r\nIt all just seems to turn the whole thing into a science vs religion, us vs them problem, which I don''t believe is helpful in the long run at all. Science is the study of God''s creation and how it works. Isn''t it enough to encourage people to look at how amazing creation is rather than trying to find "proofs" of design? Besides, surely those whose hearts are hardened enough would ignore evidence anyway?\r\n\r\n<em>"The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands."</em> - Psalm 19:1\r\n\r\n<em>"For since the creation of the world God''s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse."</em> Romans 1:20\r\n\r\nWhat do you people think?

Lopez says, "At the beginning, when I first started doing music and movies I think I had this attitude that I didn''t have to be like anyone else. I didn''t have to conform to being very thin.

After shooting was delayed following the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina last month, Quaid has put the movie on hold and has been in talks with New Orleans Police Superintendent Eddie Compass. During a relief mission in the city on Monday, Quaid asked Compass, "Can we get in here by January 1st? If there''s any way we can do it here, I want to do it here.

Some of my reasons are pretty simple: You don''t have to worry about the necessity of giving your star more importance than they''re due just because they''re the star. An example would be Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford) in Clear and Present Danger where Jack did things actually done in the book by John Clark, for example.  Animation would not have necessitated the killing off of major characters which will only impact on future films. You also can start at the beginning of a series and then age the characters appropriately.  I''d like to see the Jack Ryan series done from the first to the last with animation.

(7, '1-10', '1-10', '', '<P>1. <B>Back to the Future (Frank Darabont, 2005)</B>\r\n\r\n<P>In this unnecessary remake of the 1985 classic nostalgia-sci-fi-comedy-teen movie, teenager Mark\r\nMcFly (Freddie Prinze Jr) is thrust back in time in a CGI Range Rover and stranded in 1975 when his crazy\r\ninventing friend Dr Brown (Pierce Brosnan) is inadvertently shot by Al-qaeda agents. On arriving in his\r\nhome town in the grooooovy 70s, Mark must try to get his parents (Sarah Michelle Geller, and, er, Freddie\r\nPrinze Jr again) to fall in love, despite competition from school bully and disco master Ziff Tannen\r\n(Jake Gyllenhaal), Principal Zemickis (Michael J Fox, in a hilarious cameo), and himself! Amongst other\r\nthings,  Mark invents punk rock, rap music and performs ''the Power of Love'' to a young Huey Lewis (played\r\nby himself, in a hilarious cameo), before enlisting the help fo the younger Doc Brown and utilising a\r\nnuclear explosion to return to 2005.\r\n\r\n<P>2. <B>2101: A Space Odyssey (Michael Bay, 2004)</B>\r\n\r\n<P>Not a sequel, but a remake of Stanley Kubrick''s 1969 space-philosophy classic/piece of rubbish in\r\nwhich nothing much really happens over a very long time, but in a really pretty and profound way. This\r\nremake, directed by <I>Armageddon</I>''s Michael Bay, will focus now more on ''the plight of the crew of\r\nthe Discovery'' rather than anything else. Shawn of the ape bit at the beginning (although there will be a\r\ncomedic reference to ''monkeys throwing bones that turn into space ships''), and most of the middle, the\r\nnew, snappy movie will centre on astronaut Jim Bowen''s (Colin Farrell) escape from sinister computer\r\nHAL''s (voice of George Lucas) flesh eating robots. Will climax with 5 minutes of useless CGI effects.\r\n\r\n<P>3. <B>Way of the Dragon (Brett Ratner, 2004)</B>\r\n\r\n<P>Tom Hanks leads the cast in this remake of the 1973 Bruce Lee kung-fu classic. In the original,\r\nHong-Kong native Tau-Lung (Lee) is dispatched to Italy to help protect his cousin''s Chinese restaurant\r\nfrom vicious thugs. Cue some fighting and scenery. In this inspired remake, Jack Lung (Hanks) visits\r\nItaly to protect his cousin''s burger bar from  offensively stereotyped Islamic terrorists. Following a\r\nhilarious cameo from Chuck Norris as a taxi driver, the film is brought to an awesome climax in the\r\nColosseum where Lung must battle a kung-fu master (Luke Goss) with supernatural powers using only his\r\nmind, and robot spiders.\r\n\r\n<P>4.<B> Mary Poppins (Ridley Scott, 2006)</B>\r\n\r\n<P><I>Alien</I> and <I>Gladiator</I> director Scott is the perfect choice for this remake of the 1963\r\nDisney classic. The roles of the children have yet to be cast, but it is believed that Julie Andrews will\r\nreturn as the children''s mother, in a hilarious cameo, and the guy who plays Daphne''s brother in Frasier\r\nwill be on hand to provide an effective cockney accent as Bert the chimney sweep. Scott has said in the\r\npast that he is interested in the themes of mortality, ageing and redemption shown in the original.\r\n\r\n<P>5. <B>A James Bond film</B>\r\n\r\n<P>The next James Bond film will be a direct remake of every single James Bond film - except <I>From\r\nRussia With Love</I>, because it didn''t have many stunts in. The plot, held in a secret bunker will be\r\nsomewhere along the lines of this: some baddy, whom James Bond just escaped from before the credits, will\r\nattempt to use some kind of ludicrous device to destroy the world. James, hilariously disturbed from\r\nmaking love to some random woman, will be called in to investigate. After 15 minutes at the baddy''s\r\nparty, Bond will cop off with some woman who will soon end up dead (or be revealed to be a baddy), blow\r\nhis cover, and get shot at. Soon after, he will meet some other attractive woman who will help and hinder\r\nhim as he defeats the big baddy. Unfortunately, before the world can be saved, Bond must stop the baddy''s\r\nmain henchman, who may be a racist stereotype, from launching the doomsday device. All of this will be\r\ndone with some ker-a-zee stunts.\r\n\r\n<P>6. <B>Raiders of the Lost Ark (2008)</B>\r\n\r\n<P>George Lucas is said to be unhappy with the first instalment of he and Steven Spielberg''s thrilling\r\nIndiana Jones trilogy, and wishes to re-imagine it in a thrilling remake, starring Kiefer Sutherland as\r\nJones, Natalie Portman as his love interest Marion Ravenwood, and Harrison Ford in a hilarious cameo as\r\nhis father. The plot will closely follow that of the original, except all the action set pieces will not\r\nbe thrilling at all due to it all being done in computer graphics. Also, to tone down the violence, the\r\nfamous climax of the original, where Jones'' Nazi foes are melted by the power of the ark, will be\r\nreplaced with a scene in which the bad guys (now evil kitten smugglers) realise the error of their ways\r\nand set up a kitten farm. Also, in order to appease religious groups, the ark of the covenant will be\r\ninstead replaced by a large magic box.\r\n\r\n<P>7. <B>The Graduate (Brett Ratner, 2006)</B>\r\n\r\n<P>Josh Hartnett and Jackie Chan are to star in this action-adventure remake of the 1969 Dustin Hoffman\r\nclassic. As a graduate returning home from college, young Frank Smith (Hartnett) must find his way in the\r\nworld, and is seduced by his parent''s best friend, Mrs Robinson (Courtney Cox), while fighting off a\r\nsinister kitten smuggling gang with the help of his college pal Tau Kang (Chan). Can he stop the woman he\r\ntruly loves (Jennifer Love Hewitt) from marrying some dodgy man (Colin Firth)? Will feature at least 15\r\ndifferent pop-punk metal versions of Mrs Robinson. Instead of the\r\noft parodied church/bus ending, the climax will involve an aeroplane chase instead and lots of crazy\r\nstunts. Dustin Hoffman does no hilarious cameos, but Mr Feeny off Boy Meets World does.\r\n\r\n<P>8. <B>Open All Hours (David Cronenberg, 2004)</B>\r\n\r\n<P>This chilling sci-fi re-imagining of the classic 1970''s Ronnie Barker/David Jason comedy is a natural\r\nchoice for <I>The Fly</I> and <I>Crash</I> director Cronenberg. In it, genial Canadian corner shop owner\r\nKyle Arkwright (Jeff Goldblum) becomes convinced that his body is infested with flesh eating maggots,\r\nliterally forcing his skull to be ''open all hours''. Drawing on both metaphysical and physical ideas, and\r\ncontemplating the nature of death, life, sex and decent into madness. Featuring Kathy Staff as a giant\r\nmaggot, in a hilarious cameo.\r\n\r\n<P>9. <B>1984 (Walt Disney Productions)</B>\r\n\r\n<P>George Orwell''s classic post-war satire is on the cards to be Disney''s latest animated feature,\r\nrelocated underwater! In it, young goldfish Willie Smith works for the Ministry of Truth, where, in a\r\nchange from the books, he writes the truth. The world he lives in is oppressed by a big gangster fish Big\r\nBlowfish, who may or may not exist. On becoming disillusioned with his lonely existence, and after the\r\nkidnapping of his talking coral sidekick Karel, Willie falls in love with a beautiful goldfish called\r\nJulia who encourages him to defeat Big Blowfish. In a dramatic conclusion, Willie must escape from the\r\nFish From Room 101 (Paul Merton) and defeat Big Blowfish, who turns out to in fact be a tiny salmon!\r\nAfter this, the world is made safe and all fish are free.\r\n\r\n<P>10. <B>Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope (George Lucas)</B>\r\n\r\n<P>Star Wars director and maestro George Lucas has allegedly decided that he can''t make Episode 3''s\r\nstory and theme fit before part 4, and so has announced plans to re-imagine the original trilogy, using\r\nworse actors and better technology. Using film sampling techniques, a mixture of old and new footage will\r\nbe mixed together, replacing good performances (Alec Guinness, Peter Cushing, Harrison Ford) with\r\ninferior ones and leaving in all the dodgy ones (Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, all the X-Wing pilots, the\r\nguy who says ''Stop rebel scum!''). The biggest draw of them all, Darth Vader, will be superimposed by CGI\r\neffects of Episode 2''s Anakin, Hayden Christensen, gurning. Rumours that the Death Star''s ability to\r\ndestroy planets will be reduced to the ability to destroy small rocks are unconfirmed. But as long as it\r\nfits closer to his original vision, folks!\r\n\r\n', '2005-07-21 20:24:52', '2005-07-21 20:24:52', 2),

(25, 'Experiment', 'Experiment', '', '<h2>The Tea Experiment</h2>\r\n\r\n<P><H3>History & Background</h2>\r\n\r\n<P>On the day of April 1st, 2004, at around 11pm, Mr Mikey C (BSc) and Mr Owen P (BSc) allowed Miss Isabel Cheung to make a cup of tea, despite warnings that the milk was known to be a few days off and therefore quite nasty to the taste. On discovering the foul taste of the newly made cup of tea, Miss Cheung abandoned said drink, and ran away, never to be seen again for at least a fortnight. However, the tale does not end there. \r\n\r\n<P>The tea was then transferred into a clear pint-sized (568ml) glass, of the type commonly used in bars or pubs for drinking beer, partially because it would make an interesting experiment but mainly because I thought it would be funny.\r\n\r\n<P><IMG SRC="/tea/tea1.jpg"><br><i>Above we can see the cup of tea, complete with tea bag (Asda standard brand), the milk (originally skimmed milk held in a co-op carton) and a kettle.</i>\r\n\r\n<P><IMG SRC="/tea/reconstruction.gif"><br>\r\n<B>RECONSTRUCTION</B>\r\n\r\n<h3>Day 4</h3>\r\n\r\n<P>5-4-04\r\n<br><IMG SRC="/tea/day4.jpg"><br>\r\nAs you can see clearly from this photographic evidence, the ''tea'' element (element "B") has seperated from the ''water'' element (element "A"). This is probably because the tea is heavier than the water. The experiment smells like milk that has gone off.\r\n\r\n<P>The drink was then forgotten about for a few days while the experimentors were doing something more important.\r\n\r\n<P><h3>Day 15</h3>\r\n<P>16-04-04\r\n<br><IMG SRC="/tea/day15.jpg"><br>\r\nAs the above photograph shows, by Day 15, the experiment had begun to grow what appeared to be mould on it. There is speculation as to whether this mould is there because of the tea, the milk, or just because its just the cool place to be. Whatever the cause, this looks very interesting indeed. As you can see, elements A and B are still seperate. An interesting side effect is that the tea is starting to smell quite bad.\r\n\r\n<P><h3>Day 25</h3>\r\n<P>26-04-04\r\n<br><IMG SRC="/tea/day25.jpg"><br>\r\nOn day 25, the return of a Mr JFK Armitage required the rehousing of the experiment. It was felt by him that the need to not have some kind of mouldy thing growing in his room outweighed the interests of science. The scientists were reluctant to do this, fearing the mixing of the two elements may cause some kind of cataclysmic event, but Mr Armitage is bigger than me and so the scientists relented. The new home of the experiment was the outhouse. \r\n\r\n<P>As you can see from the photograph, the fungal growth is now almost fully covering the surface of the liquid. It now smells a bit like a public toilet, which is odd because nobody has weed in it. An important consideration to make at this point is that the glass has been moved, and so this may affect our results.\r\n\r\n<P><h3>Day 86</h3>\r\n\r\n<P>We suddenly remembered that we''d left the mysterious experiment in the outhouse. Fearing the worst, the scientists opened the door, fearing a room full of mould, or, worse, some kind of sentient being. Mr Mikey C had even created some kind of universal communication device in order to talk to the being. Sadly it was jus the same as it was before, only a bit mouldier. It was then that we knew it was time to call the Mouldy Tea Fairy and have it taken away, before Environmental Health heard about it anyway. \r\n<P>CONCLUSION\r\n<P>Leaving tea for weeks is a waste of time.

But that joy was not to last. In this exclusive extract from George Lucas''s book, designed to really annoy the writers of those novels, their tragic fates are revealed. George reveals: "I was always really interested in the mythological quest archetype and certain other motives. The reason why I didn''t do Episode VII, even though I had the story planned, was because it was depressing and rubbish."\r\n\r\n<h2>Lando Calrissian</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Lando Calrissian''s amazing clapping, seen in the final shot of Return of the Jedi, proved useful in his future job as a compere at a variety club on Naboo. He took up this job after a brief period as a general in the New Republic, which he left because he was too much of a scoundrel. During his time on Naboo, Calrissian compered many acts, including Sy Snootles, Admiral Ackbar and Max Rebo, and killed 17 Gun-guns.\r\n\r\n<h2>Han Solo</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Han Solo married Princess Leia about a year after the end of <i>Jedi</i>. Tragically killed only 6 weeks later by a gang of angry racist Wookiees while visiting Chewbacca on Kashyyk.\r\n\r\n<h2>Princess Leia</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon after her marriage to Han Solo, Leia became depressed since all her lifes goals had become complete and she didn''t know what to do. Her husband was supportive, but after his tragic death, Leia became more and more depressed. She eventually took up table tennis, and became champion beating the previous winner, the pit of Sarlacc 11-0.\r\n\r\n<h2>Luke Skywalker</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>At the advice of the ghosts of Yoda and Obi-Wan, Luke went scouting the galaxy for youngsters with high midi-cholorian rates to train as new Jedi. None of them wanted to be Jedi, however, and Luke became a professional magician, even reaching the heights of playing at Lando''s club, before hitting rock bottom and becoming addicted to death sticks. He never got over the fact that he really fancied his sister, and after a brief spell as a con artist, was last seen moving marbles in exchange for beer.\r\n\r\n<h2>Wedge Antilles</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Wedge became president of the galaxy and everyone loves him. \r\n\r\n<h2>C3-P0</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Threepio decided to stay on Endor''s forest moon where he lived for many months with his Ewok friends, before he began to miss his companion Artoo.

Threepio was last seen in the possession of Max Rebo.\r\n\r\n<h2>Emperor Palpatine</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The ghost of Darth Sidious was said to haunt the moon of Endor, and he would periodically pop up and annoy the Ewoks. He could not interact physically with them so all he would do was pretend to be trapped in a well or something, so all the Ewoks would try and get him out. When they reached the bottom he would laugh at them. It was the most evil thing he could think of at the time.</p>', '2005-07-20 22:46:07', '2005-07-20 22:46:07', 16),

Only Mary Steenburgen and Crispin Glover return from the original trilogy, along with writer Bob Gale. "It''s amazing," Gale told ME yesterday, "The script just FLOWED."

McGoohan takes to the stage and immediatly launches into a rendition of new single <em>Placemat</em> before mumbling something incoherant to guitarist and schoolfriend Georgios Santandez. It is a measure of how far they have come in just 2 years by the way that they are no longer afraid of a diminshed 7. By the time they launch into early hit <em>I''m Here & I''m Now</em> the few detractors are silenced. Tonight, the <em>Burning Place</em> rule.

Y''know, I was on the bus the other day and I overheard people discussing the possible results of the Millennium Bug on their lives. It''s odd, how a simple problem such as this can have such a detrimental effect on our lives. I say ''our'' even though, I, being an artificial life form, am technically not alive, although my acting in <I>Short Circuit </I>had you fooled, didn''t it?<P> I was constructed by IBM in 1976 and run on an Intel 8086 processor, have 8K RAM and run at 2 MHz, and I''ve been working for over twenty years, and according to "Bug cracker 2000 Pro" I''ll be unaffected by this simple programming shortcut. But, unfortunately, Hollywood don''t care. Since my starring roles in the <I>Short Circuit</I> films, I''ve had a trickle of roles coming in. The last major part I had was in <I>Jurassic Park\r\n</I> (I played Jeff Goldblum). The fact is that there is a millennium-bug fear, heightening the current Hollywood trend of Robophobia. My robotic friend Arnold Schwarzenegger, when in the Terminator, was forced to use a human actor for the final scene where he comes up with no skin because, claims James Cameron, "his robotic endo-skeleton didn''t fit in with the feel of the film".

Being men, our job is to drink as much of it as possible, in as little time as possible, until we can no longer be held responsible for our stupid actions. However, some people, normally people who wear glasses, or maybe even have ginger hair, or like the Smiths, cannot drink lots of beer, because they are girly. If you are one of those people, this is how to drink lots of beer and not pass out.</P>\r\n<B>1.</B> Go into a pub. Of course, you go to a pub every night anyway, so we don''t need to tell you this.</br>\r\n<B>2.</B> Order a pint of beer. Choosing the correct beer for your personality type is vital. The wrong type of beer can result in reduced drinkage pleasure<br>\r\n<B>3.</B> Drink this beer. Drink it within about 15 minutes. Too fast, and you may get drunk too early. Too slow, and you won''t get drunk enough.<br>\r\n<B>4.</B> Order another beer. Order the same type, or buy another type. Remember, it must be a pint, because you are a man.<br>\r\n<B>5.</B> Drink this beer. You can drink this beer slower than the previous beer, because you have already proven your manliness.<br>\r\n<B>6.</B> Go to the toilet as soon as you feel you need to go. Wetting yourself may result in being laughed at, or, in extreme circumstances, being laughed at by a girl.<br>\r\n<B>7.</B> Drink as many beers as you can afford until you are turfed out of the pub. Remember not to leave before closing time, except in extreme circumstances, such as a bomb scare or the sudden death of a loved one.<br>\r\n<B>8. </B>Stumble home about 12. Remember you must have enough co-ordination to unlock your front door, otherwise you may be forced to sleep outside, risking getting cold and wet.</P>\r\n<P>These tips should help you to have a good night of excessive drinking in a pub at least four times a week.</P>\r\n\r\n<H2>HILARIOUS REAL LIFE STORIES</H2>\r\n<P>I was with my girlfriend, and her parents, and I forgot to do my fly up when I went to the toilet!

(41, 'Radiohead Fan Diary', 'Headfan', '', 'Mike-Net was having a walk yesterday and came across the following\r\ndiary by a typical Radiohead fan, clearly abandoned and lost, in\r\nsomeone''s house. It clearly is real, and so cannot be accused as a\r\nrip-off of anything else. So there.\r\n<h2>June 4th</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Went out and bought Amnesiac. It''s fantastic! I really feel Thom''s\r\nisolation in this one. It''s definitely the best one yet. I''ve been\r\nlistening to it non-stop. I got the special book edition, and the\r\nnormal CD so I won''t damage the book, and another CD in case I lost the\r\nfirst CD by taking it around with me, and the tape because Radiohead\r\nare so good at doing cassette sleeves, a quality so often overlooked.\r\nStanley Downwood is a genius!\r\n</p><p>I have to say that so far my favourite tracks are all of them,\r\nexcept for Knives Out which is a bit too commercial, and I heard Thom\r\ndidn''t like it for a long time. Maybe I will like it soon. It must be\r\nreally good, because it is by Radiohead! Morning Bill got his copy a\r\nweek ago from an indie record shop. He also downloaded all the songs\r\noff Napster anyway but I really wanted to wait because that''s much more\r\nexciting. He bought it for the artwork anyway.\r\n</p><h2>June 5th</h2>\r\n<p>Listened to Amnesiac before going to school, and I brought in the CD\r\nto show all my friends. They all think its ace, except for John, he\r\nthinks Thom is stupid. I tried to play it in the common room but I got\r\ntold it was rubbish by lots of people who called them pretentious and\r\narrogant. I nearly cried. How could some call Colin pretentious? He''s a\r\nbassist! Anyway, Julie told me they weren''t any good since The Bends\r\nand that Smashing Pumpkins are much better. Well Billy Corgan does look\r\na bit like Phil, but apart from that Radiohead are much better.\r\n</p><p>I am hoping to get that rare Charles Mingus bootleg off Morning\r\nBill on the internet this week. He really was an ace musical visionary,\r\nlike Jonny and Thom! Except not as wonderful. Listened to OK Computer\r\nas soon as I got home. It''s so great!\r\n</p><h2>June 6th</h2>\r\n<p>I received my new Radiohead badge in the post this morning. It''s\r\nround and says ''I love Radiohead'' on it. Morning Bill said he''d sent\r\nthe Mingus bootlegs to my via e-mail. I got a new e-mail address,\r\nThomThom@Thom.com.\r\n</p><p>Listened to Amnesiac again. Nearly cried with joy. Julie said\r\nat school today that Thom Yorke had a freaky eye. I pointed out that\r\nBilly Corgan had a freaky voice. Got into an argument with Jim about\r\nTony Blair. I said that he was useless and evil, like Thom said. Jim\r\nsaid he was just evil. I nearly freaked. Kicking Screamin'' Gucci Little\r\nPiggy! Wow, that bit in Paranoid Android makes me scream in anger!\r\n</p><h2>June 15th</h2>\r\n<p>Lost my diary then. This week I managed to get tickets for the\r\nRadiohead gig in Oxford next month. I''m so excited! Listened to the\r\nBends twice this morning, then Kid A. The musical visionary is\r\nbrilliant!\r\n</p><p>On the Radiohead chat room I had a chat with Morning Bill and\r\nDebaser Paul. Debaser said that Morning Bell was a rubbish song, but I\r\npointed out that it moved me to tears whenever I visualised Thom\r\ncutting the kids in half (metaphorically!) but he said that the drums\r\nwere repetitive but I said all songs were by their very nature\r\nrepetitive which is what makes me love them. And Thom said it was god\r\nand so it must be by definition really good. Bill said that he liked\r\nMorning Bell which is why he named himself after it. He used to be\r\ncalled Paranoid BillDroid. Morning Bill is my best friend. If he didn''t\r\nlive in Canada we''d do everything together.\r\n</p><p>Heard a Radiohead song today on the telly! It was\r\nElectioneering, on Eastenders. I hate Eastenders because Jonny made\r\nsome comment about it. Watched Meeting People Is Easy again. That bit\r\nwhere Thom looks sad on the escalator makes my cry, so does the bit\r\nwhere Colin says they aren''t happy. Its so hard being Radiohead!\r\n</p><h2>June 17th</h2>\r\n<p>Got that Mingus bootleg downloaded fully. It''s really good. I don''t\r\nlike it much, because it''s jazz, but since Jonny and Thom love it I do\r\ntoo. Watched my compilation of Radiohead videos. I''ve got all of them,\r\neven Pop Is Dead, which, despite being rubbish, is really good. It\r\nmakes me cry when I hear the lyrics... ''Pop is dead...long live pop.''\r\neven in 1992 Thom was trying to break through the lyrical form.\r\nListened to my Japanese import Pablo Honey again, and played Street\r\nSpirit on my guitar. Just realised Idioteque is really intense! Ice age\r\ncoming!\r\n</p><p>Morning Bill e-mailed me again. When I''m feeling low he really\r\ncheers me up. He''s got a limited edition 13-inch picture disc of ''Stop\r\nWhispering'' from Germany. I''m so jealous! He says that there''s only 250\r\ncopies in existence as most were binned because they were and inch too\r\nbig to fit on most record players. I''m still so jealous! It has a\r\npicture of a cow on it, like Pink Floyd. I spent ages trying to get a\r\ncopy of the Drill EP about a year ago, and Morning Bill, or Paranoid\r\nBilldroid as he was then, helped me. He''s so cool!\r\n</p><p>I''d better stop writing now, my mum says I have to tidy my\r\nroom. I got two new e-mail addresses today as well -\r\nPyramidSinger@thom.com and HuntedBear@Thom.com\r\n</p><h2>June 19th</h2>\r\n<p>My big Jonny Greenwood poster fell down off the ceiling on top of me\r\nwhen I was sleeping but its OK because its Phil''s turn to be up there\r\nthis time. I lost one of my copies of Amnesiac at school today in the\r\ncommon room. Jim says Julie stole it but I know he''s lying because she\r\nalready has it and she thinks its rubbish. </p><p>Got into a massive argument with a Linkin Park fan. She thinks\r\nthat Stinkin Park are much more intense than Radiohead and that Thom is\r\ntoo ugly to be alive! I bet she stole my copy of Amnesiac, the idiot.\r\nShe told me that if she saw Thom is the street she''d stare and laugh\r\nand I told her she was really insensitive and so I told her that if I\r\nsaw Linkin Park I''d shoot them. Then she said that if ever there was\r\nproof of the badness of Radiohead its that they''re big whingers. So\r\nduring Science I stole her Limp Bizkit ruler and wrote "Thom Yorke\r\nforever!" on it and I''ve spent all evening text messaging her on my\r\nphone about how bad Stinkin Park are. She''s really shallow and carries\r\nher phone around with her everywhere so she''ll be annoyed for ages! I\r\nused to carry my phone about too, but then I heard "mobiles chirping"\r\nand realised they were a scourge on society, like cars, and major\r\nrecord labels.\r\n</p><p>Got a new e-mail address\r\nYorkeGreenwoodGreenwoodSelwayOBrian@Thom.com and\r\nThomColinJonnyPhilEd@thom.com. I''ll have to tell everyone to use these\r\naddresses, so they can memorise Radiohead''s names fully. It''ll be\r\nhelpful because every so often I just start going on about Jonny and Ed\r\nand my dad doesn''t have any idea what I''m on about. Though I think he\r\nknows really. </p><h2>June 20th</h2>\r\n<p>My english essay was due in for today. The teacher was really angry\r\nbut I told her that I kept scrapping what I''d done and stuff. But I''d\r\nalso been listening to Kid A and Amnesiac all the time too. I told her\r\nif she gave me ages I''d be able to write two interesting and\r\nexperimental essays. She said that she wouldn''t want to read those,\r\nbecause they''d be rubbish and hard to read. I don''t know what she\r\nmeant.\r\n</p><h2>June 23rd</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I bought the Autechre album today. I don''t like it at all, but its\r\nreally good. You can tell why Thom loves it. It really shows\r\nalienation. I''m glad I''m a Radiohead fan so I can learn about all these\r\nace bands, and stuff. I''m so glad I''m not a Manics fan any more!\r\n', '2005-07-13 21:55:31', '2005-07-13 21:55:31', 24),

Damon''s [Albarn - singer] got his Gorrilaz thing [cartoon\r\nside project], and Graham [Coxon - guitar] wants to do an album of\r\nbackwards lo-fi reggae punk on his own, so we asked them if they\r\nthought we could carry it off as the two of us. They said ''We''d like to\r\nsee you try'' - ha ha, so we thought ''lets go for it!''".</p><p>Dave was\r\nunavailible for comment, but may have said "This is a new phase for\r\nBlur. Alex and I may be not normally associated with lead instruments\r\nbut Alex knows a few chords and can sing a bit. And I can make web\r\nsites." he may have added, had he said anything.\r\n</p><p>However, the album may be released under an assumed name; <b>James</b> also expresses the wish that his <b>Fat Les</b> comrades <b>Keith Allen</b> and arty fool <b>Damien Hurst</b> join as session musicians and co-writers.

The guitar was an integral and common part of pop music up until the late 90s when it was replaced by what was once known as a pair of cheap record players. IDIOTS! It consists of, in its simplest form, a big hollow box with a hole in it and 6 strings across it. It might be just the strings, with a big spekaer next to it.

Abba were terrible, as are you apparently. Listen, if you are going to argue with your friends AT LEAST HAVE AN ARGUMENT THAT ISN''T COMPLETE NONSENSE! You should be shot! Along with Abba!

I''ve\r\ntaken time out of my busy schedule of filming, editing, bathing and\r\nhaving dinner with my pals Steven Spielberg and Francis Coppola to\r\nchair this Q & A session with you, the nerdy Star Wars fan. I am\r\naware that starwars.com has a similar feature, but the people who\r\nanswer that are just idiots really. OK here we go:..."</p>\r\n<p><b>Q: Why does Qui-Gonn not disappear when he dies like Yoda, Obi-Wan and Vader do?</b> <i>Yoda''s ears, Dagobah.</i><br>\r\nA: Hmm, now then, I forgot about that one. How about this. When there\r\nwere loads of Jedi, they didn''t need to disappear because they didn''t\r\nneed to appear as ghosts to guide the other Jedi as there were already\r\nloads to do that. See? Simple. That''ll be explained in Episode 2 - no -\r\n3.</p>\r\n<p><b>Q: How come in Episodes V & VI Obi-Wan clearly states Yoda trained him when Qui-Gonn actually did?</b> <i>Darth Jimmy, Stoke </i><br>\r\nA: Er... right then. It''s because Qui-Gonn was dead see? And Yoda did\r\ntrain him a bit. Didn''t you see? Also, er, man these questions are\r\ntough. I''ll explain it in Episode 3.</p>\r\n<p><b>Q: Darth Maul is the best thing in The Phantom Menace. In fact, I''d go so far as to say he''s the <i>only</i> good thing in it. Why did you kill him off? Are you stupid?</b> <i>Death Star 77, Seattle</i><br>\r\nA: I didn''t kill him off. Obi-Wan did. And also, he didn''t fit into my\r\nintense 9-part story, so he had to go. But the good news is that Jar\r\nJar Binks, so critically derided in <i>Menace</i>, plays a much larger part in Part 2. His point is explained in Episode 3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Q: How do you react to people who claim Star Wars is full of racial stereotypes?</b><i> Admiral Ackbar, Jupiter</i><br>\r\nA: Pfft. As if. No more than, say, Herge''s adventures of Tin-Tin, or Gone With The Wind. All will be explained in Episode 3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Q: Which is best? Star Wars or Indiana Jones?</b><i> Harrison Ford</i><br>\r\nA: Probably Star Wars, because all the actors were cheaper. And the\r\ntoys are better. Have you seen the Star Wars lego? It''s genius. I have\r\na TIE Fighter and an X-Wing and we''re using them for the effects in the\r\nnew movie. Only joking! I''ll tell you which is best when I''ve finished\r\nEpisode 3.\r\n</p><p><b>Q: Are you planning to create a spin-off series, like Ewoks, featuring the loveable Gun-Guns?</b> <i>Queen Amidala''s Evil Twin, Zurich</i> <br>A:\r\nThere is always the possibility of a cheap spin-off series, and the\r\nGun-Guns was an early idea. However, I decided that, unlike the Ewoks,\r\nthe Gun-Guns are a much to ugly race to have a kids TV show about. I''m\r\nthinking more about a series of cop shows about Yoda and Boba Fett''s\r\ndetective agency.\r\n</p><p><b>Q: In the cartoon series Droids, all about the adventures of\r\nC3P0 and R2D2 before the original trilogy, there is no mention of\r\nanything that happens in Episode 1, or anything. Why?</b><i> Fred Skywalker, Barnsley</i><br>\r\nA: Because.... It''s all explained in episodes 2 and 3. You''ll kick yourself when you see it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Q: Oh and how come Obi-Wan doesn''t recognise R2 and 3P0 in Episode 4?</b>  <i>Fred Skywalker, Barnsley</i><br>\r\nOh come on, all the droids look the same. You can hardly expect him to\r\nrecognize them after thirty odd years.

I have heard that people are dying in the street of the illness\r\nin Britain, and they have taken to giving burnt offerings of their farm\r\nanimals to MAFF, god of pestilence, so desperate is their plight.\r\nAlthough people have stopped dying in the street, thanks to these\r\nsacrifices, many farmers seem to have run out of animals to sell at\r\nmarkets and as such are now skint - they also want to know how to avoid\r\nany further disruption from the english hordes.

It''s a very clever\r\ntechnique thought up by incredible government scientists and so far it\r\nhas worked brilliantly; in fact, thanks to this system it is thought\r\nthat by the end of the outbreak there may be as many as five sheep in\r\nthe entire british isles.\r\n</p><p><b>George, can we have some money off you because you''re rich and our livelyhood has been destroyed?</b> <i>A farmer</i><br>No,\r\nyou can''t.

But luckily I have a big Poke-encyclopedia in front of me, so lets begin.\r\n\r\n</P>\r\n<P><B>Q: What are the best nicknames for Pokemon?</B><br>\r\nA: Nicknames are a matter of personal preference, but my favourites are Graham, Duracell, NinjaSpoo, Ringo, PeeWee, Fujitsu, Daphne and Celeste. All my 148 Pokemon are called one of these names.\r\n\r\n<P><B>Q: Which is the best type of Pokemon?</B><br>\r\nA: All Pokemon have different strengths and weaknesses, so none are really better than others. Except for MewTwo, of course. He is well hard. Ha!\r\n\r\n<P><B>Q: Who is Mew?</B><br>\r\nA: Mew is the greek letter often used in algebraic physics problems, for example to represent the co-effieceint of friction. What has this got to do with Pokemon? I don''t know; I really should look this stuff up.\r\n\r\n<P>\r\n<B>Q: MewTwo? Didn''t they release the album ''Achtung Baby''?</B><br>\r\nA: No.</P>\r\n\r\n<H2>November 2000</H2>\r\n\r\nFrequently asked questions about <B>PokÃËœmon</B> answered by <B>Professor Oak.</B></P></center>\r\n<P>\r\n<img src="profoak.gif" align=left>"Hi, I''m Professor Oak, people call me the PokÃËœmon Prof. I don''t know why; I don''t really know much about PokÃËœmon at all. But luckily I have a big PokÃËœ-encyclopedia in front of me, so lets begin.\r\n\r\n</P>\r\n<P><B>Q: My Pikachu is angry with me and won''t do what I say! What should I do?</B><br>\r\nA: A bit of old-fashioned discipline should put your Pikachu into line. When he next disobeys you, connect his electricity-attack parts together with a short copper wire. This will cause you Pikachu to faint painfully. Ha! you can do this as much as you like because PokÃËœmon don''t die, however much you mistreat them. I know. I''m the PokÃËœmon Prof.\r\n\r\n<P><B>Q: Which is the worst type of PokÃËœmon?</B><br>\r\nA: I can tell you that my least favourite type of PokÃËœmon is Charmander, but that''s only because one of those damn things keeps stealing my gin.\r\n\r\n<P><B>Q: What should I do if my PokÃËœballs are ineffective?</B><br>\r\nA: Check the best-before date on your PokÃËœballs. If it is after April chuck them out. This batch was infected with Ball-Fatigue, which causes them to be unable to catch certain types of PokÃËœmon. However, the only type of Pokeball which you can use to catch all types of PokÃËœmon with is the UltraBall, which is also known as the Imaginary Ball due to its rarity. I have one however, and I found it in my garden. It came from outer space, y''know. It spoke to me, and then I passed out.\r\n\r\n\r\n<P>\r\n<B>Q: Is there a legendary 152nd Pokemon?</B><br>\r\nA: It is belived, by careful analysis of fossils and droppings, that their is a non-extinct extremly rare 152nd Pokemon, called Scabulon. It is thought that Scabulon can actually kill anyone who sees it by destroying their minds, which probably explains why no-one has seen one. I prefer to destroy my mind with gin, however. That reminds me I sent Gary into town to buy me three litres of gin an hour ago, where is the little .... oh next question.</P>\r\n\r\n<P>\r\n<B>Q: How did Pokemon first arrive on the PokÃËœ-World?</B><br>\r\nA: They came from Japan, I believe, on the back of a combined harvester.</P>\r\n\r\n<H2>December 2000</H2>\r\n\r\nFrequently asked questions about <B>PokÃËœmon</B> answered by <B>Professor Oak.</B></P></center>\r\n<P>\r\n<img src="profoak.gif" align=left>"Hi, I''m Professor Oak, people call me the PokÃËœmon Prof. I don''t know why; I don''t really know much about PokÃËœmon at all.

What should I do?</B><br>\r\nA: If you inject your Pikachu with horrific allogens, it will come out in a nasty nasty rash, and will be totally undesirable to anyone! Alternatively, feed it gin, although make sure it is NOT MINE.\r\n\r\n<P><B>Q: How do you get your hair to stick up like that?</B><br>\r\nA: Eh?

Why is this?</B><br>\r\nA: Hmm. go away.\r\n\r\n\r\n<P>\r\n<B>Q: Is it true that Pokemon is an evil ploy made by mad japanese advertising experts?</B><br>\r\nA: Well of course initially Pokemon were used for simple farming tasks, but it more recent years, yes, they have become evil and bad. This is more to do with the general bad quality of the gin around here than the actions of any mad  japanese advertising experts, however. You see i have to import my gin from the online spirit sellers jeeow.com, and by the time i get do it those DARN CHARMANDERS have DRUNK THE LOT. So I have to whip them which makes them very angry, and they try to set fire to my house.</P>\r\n\r\n<P>\r\n<B>Q: Where can I find a Pikachu?</B><br>\r\nA: $6.99 from ProfOak.com.

I got Pokemon Yellow too but its identical to Pokemon Red with less of me in it. Scandal!\r\n\r\n</P>\r\n<P><B>Q: I can''t get past the four guardians of Fuscia city without having all my Pokemon fainted. Do you have any cheats?</B><br>\r\nA: Cheating will have you instantly dissmissed from the Pokemon league, but if  you kill all the witnessess this will not be a problem. My personal favourite trick is to employ a hardman to break the legs of the opponent while he sleeps before the match, before stealing all his Pokemon and replacing them with fish. Imagine his surprise when he is unable to get up to challenge you! And if he does get there, imagine his surprise when all he has to battle with are fish! Ho ho ho.\r\n\r\n<P><B>Q: My friend says that there is a secret to unlock Mew, the legendary 151st Pokemon. Is this true and if so what is it?</B><br>\r\nA: Are you all obsessed with cheats? The morals in this society really have gone downhill. Yes, you can unlock Mew. You must distract the guard with some gin (NOT MINE) and break into Brock''s Gym in the dead of night. Then you must tap your feet together three times and say ''there''s no place like home''. You will then be back home. Hope this helps. What was the question again? Where''s my gin?\r\n\r\n<P><B>Q: Do you have a drink problem?</B><br>\r\nA: No, I don''t have any kind of problems with drink. I love it.\r\n\r\n\r\n<P>\r\n<B>Q: I traded my Level 3 Geodude for my friend''s Level 97 MewTwo when she wasn''t looking, but it ignores what I say! Why?</B><br>\r\nA: This is because a Geodude has no legs, MewTwo has 2. This gives a mean leg count of one leg. You need a mean amount of zero legs. Gin makes you legless. Ha ha!</P>\r\n\r\n<P>\r\n<B>Q: Where''s the cheapest shop to by Ultraballs?</B><br>\r\nA: $6.99 for 3 from ProfOak.com. 15 packs in stock RIGHT NOW! Order now and get a free Strange Gem.

(51, 'Pugwalls Guide To The Record Industry 1', 'Pugwall', '', '<p>"Hi, I''m Pugwall, star of Pugwall, and Pugwall''s Summer. I''m\r\npresenting a three part guide on how to make it in the music industry,\r\nas my band, the Orange Organics, would have done, were we not fictional\r\nand Australian."</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Part 1: Getting noticed</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important thing about being a pop star is being famous (and\r\nmaybe being rich) and so it is therefore vitally important that you get\r\nyourself noticed by somebody who is also famous (or someone who knows\r\nsomeone who is famous). However, it is vitally important that you only\r\ndo this when you have become suitably talented or professional - don''t\r\nworry, in this context they both mean exactly the same thing.\r\n</p><h2>Get a talent</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This talent can be anything; singing, dancing, miming, DJ''ing,\r\nrapping, MC''ing (this is rapping except for idiots), or being able to\r\noperate a drum machine. Once you have practiced this, and are\r\nrelatively attractive, you can begin your route into pop stardom. If\r\nyou are a bit ugly, don''t worry; you can become a superstar DJ, MC or\r\ndrummer. Also don''t forget each pop group has a customary ugly member.\r\n</p><h2>Practice your talent</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Because I had the added advantage of being fictional, I did not need\r\nto practice my talent hugely. However, because you are real, and quite\r\npossibly stupid, you will need to practice your talent considerably.\r\nDon''t worry if you aren''t very good at all, a quite scary burning\r\ndesire for fame and love will get you there. If your talent requires\r\nit, spend lots of money on equipment. Famous people are as impressed by\r\nexpensive stuff as talent, and talented people with expensive stuff\r\nreally really impresses them. It is also worth spending money on\r\nlessons.\r\n</p><h2>Buy some clothes that are street</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Famous people are well impressed by clothes that are street and\r\ncool. Remember to make sure they aren''t too street as you will look\r\nreally stupid. Also make sure you look suitably underground. By that I\r\nmean cool, not looking underground literally. That would mean you were\r\nan idiot! But anyway. Buy clothes that are stupidly expensive and look\r\ndirt cheap. This is far less risky than buying dirt cheap clothes that\r\nlook stupidly expensive. Famous people are impressed with people who\r\nspend a lot to look street. If your chosen genre however does not\r\nrequire streetness, you can ignore this section, although its a bit\r\nlate to tell you that now, but anyway.\r\n</p><h2>Read up extensively on your chosen genre of music/commercial audio entertainment</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You cannot be a pop star or whatever if you know nothing about\r\nmusic. It is very useful to spend a few hours a day reading guides and\r\nspecialist magazine relevant to your genre. If you are into a dance\r\nthing go to lots of clubs and stuff like that, and note down the names\r\nof the DJs. Then check if they are mentioned positively in your\r\nmagazine. This is a skillful way of knowing cool movers and shakers in\r\nyour scene. Also make sure you only like records directly influenced by\r\nor on your chosen style. Admitting to liking non dancey garage stuff,\r\nfor example, would result in ostracisation from the garage scene. Yeah.\r\n<br>Safe name-drops: Basement Jaxx, Otis Redding, Chic, Abba, Public\r\nEnemy, Massive Attack. Namedrop anyone else with severe caution.\r\n</p><h2>Get noticed</h2>Do something high-profile involving your\r\ntalent. Like DJ-ing naked on Oxford Street. You know you want to. This\r\nwill get you noticed by some famous person. Then you will ahve begun on\r\nyou road to being incredibly cool and famous. Hooray!\r\n<p>That''s all for this time, folks. But ''till next time, remember my name, Pugwall. Keep rockin'', kids!\r\n', '2005-07-13 22:01:16', '2005-07-13 22:01:16', 24),
(52, 'Pugwalls Guide To The Record Industry 2', 'Pugwall2', '', '<p><img src="pugwall2_files/pugwall.htm" alt="Pugwall. I assume he is playing guitar. The alternative is quite worrying" align="left">Hey hey, it''s me, <b>Pugwall</b>, aka lead singer of Australian beat combo the <i>Orange Organics.</i>\r\nOften people ask me "Pugwall, how did you become so successful and\r\nsuceed in the record industry?" and I tell them "go to mike-net.co.uk\r\nand I''ll tell you how, fool!" (You see, when you are famous you can\r\ncall people a fool and get away with it).\r\n</p><p> If you remember, last time''s episode was about how to get\r\nnoticed initially. The next step is to get a good record deal. Of\r\ncourse, once you are noticed and have a record deal don''t get\r\ncomplacent - people can quite easily decide to start ignoring you\r\nagain. Especially if your second single is crap.\r\n</p><h1>Part 2 - the record deal</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>Attracting the attention of middle-aged record executives</h2>This\r\nis very easy. Just follow last time''s advice, only really exagerrate\r\nit. Also pretend to like old person''s music, like 70''s punk. Also be a\r\nbit rebellious. Swear on stage, and if possible make a reference to\r\ndrug taking, or at least Barcardi Breezers.\r\n<h2> Choosing a record company</h2>Once you have the attention of\r\nrecord company executives, you must choose a record company. This may\r\nseem easy sice there''s actually only about 4 anyway, but in fact they\r\nall have different subsidiaries to fool and confound you. Choosing the\r\ncorrect record company and correct label within it is a deep and\r\ncomplex skill that only the greats like Mariah Carey possess. Make sure\r\nthe label is a cool one. Ones to avoid are Poptones, Island and\r\nwhatever one Toploader is on.\r\n<h2> Signing your life away</h2>Make sure you bring a pen with you.\r\nThis will impress the executives. Remember to tread the line between\r\nimpressing them and infuriating them with your new-fangled\r\nyouthfullness. (Call them ''suits'' and ''corporate pigs,'' or just ''sir'').\r\nBefore signing, make sure you have a get-out clause in case you want to\r\nset up a barber''s shop in Nashville or something.\r\n<h2> Choosing a recording studio </h2>Make sure it has enough space\r\nfor all of you to fit in. Also check it has at least one working\r\nrecording device in each room - there''s nothing worse than a recording\r\nstudio with no recorders. <h2>Choosing a producer</h2>\r\n\r\nGet that guy who''s Shania Twain''s husband in. Failing that, get the Neptunes. That''d be cool.\r\n\r\n', '2005-07-13 22:01:38', '2005-07-13 22:01:38', 24),

In a shock web cast on their site yesterday, Ed explained how previous announcements had been to "buy time" and that the band had been "wasting EMI''s money having a fantastic holiday", and have recorded only one track, a cover of Christina Aguilera''s hit "Genie In A Bottle".</P>\r\n<P>"We arrived at the studio in the best of spirits, ready to record, with thousands of ideas" he continued apologetically, "but all we could come up with was one song which we later realised was an All Saints one which must''ve subconsiously entered or brains somehow."</P>\r\n<P>"It was weird because Jonny had all these amazing out-of-these-world chord sequences, Thom had these incredible lyrics scribble down, and we had this fantastic melody, but we just couldn''t get them all to mesh together in one whole. There was this one song, ''Claustrophobiaopolis'', with the most incredible stuff Thom''d ever written, but he chucked it or something when he nearly got run over and took it as a dark omen from the spirits."</P>\r\n<P>"Thats another thing, Thom''s become very spiritual recently and was refusing to record any vocals unless he did it outside while hugging a tree. He thinks the trees give him energy or something, we''re quite worried about him to be honest."</P>\r\n<P>Ed also made it clear that the band were not going to split: "We are definitly not going to split, we''ve been together for, ooh, ages, and we have no intention of splitting. No. Not at all.</P>\r\n<P>However when asked if the albums release date of September 2000 was still likely, Ed said "We''re commited to that date, and we feel that we can record our album in a fortnight or so... that date still seems feasible. Jonny''s got some new amazing out-of-this-world chord sequences, and Thom''s got some new lyrics in a kind of Levellers/Enya style. Phil''s got this new drum technique too, where he puts his shoes on his hands and beats the kit with that.

Luckily we spotted his brother, bassist Colin, in a pub with a friend, and when he left we kidnapped his scouse friend for interrogation.</P>\r\n<P>"Colin says that the band are planning to have a proper circus going on." he explained. Are the posters, asked Mike-Net, describing the concert as a ''genuine freakshow'' just being ironic? "No, there actually will be a freakshow. That Matt Bellamy out of Muse will be there and everything." Does this justify the Ã‘â€˜25 price tag? "Britney Spears will be in the freak show too". Mike-Net is on the phone to his favourite touts right now. </P>\r\n<P>After releasing Colin''s friend, who we later realised was actually musician Paul McCartney, Mike-Net attemted to further discover the brilliance of the tour, but to no avail. However, we did come across a writer for Rolling Stone who was looking for Supergrass, while listening to Semisonic. We also caught up with a Q magazine journalist who had been listening to some demos, describing them as "the feeling of every bone in your body shining into the backwards majesty of a damn good bassline."</P>\r\n\r\n<I>No members of Radiohead or their friends were harmed in the making of this report. </I>         \r\n	<B></B></P>\r\n\r\n<h2>August 2000</h2>\r\n<P><B>RADIOHEAD ARE THE PIXIES?</B></P>\r\n<P> </P>\r\n<p> <I>Radiohead''s long awaited album written by elves</I></p>\r\n<P>\r\n<B>Mike-Net</B> can exclusively reveal that the band ''Radiohead'' have been relaxing since mid-1999 and the forthcoming album ''Kid A'' was written by elves. Radiohead bassist Colin Greenwood explained "We got bored, and some elves that Thom [Yorke, singer] knew offered to come in and do the album for us. They had a proven track record... they did that Beatles one, y''know, Revolver? Anyway, we payed them Ã‘â€˜5 and a packet of peanuts and they''ve produced Kid A for us." So what you''re saying is that the new material was written by elves? "Er... yes. What part don''t you understand. I''m off to the bar. you want another drink?" no thanks, Mike-Net doesn''t get drunk on duty. </P>\r\n<P> "Letting elves create albums is nothing new," explained leading pop psychologist Francis Beard, "for example, Dark Side Of The Moon, Be Here Now, all Phil Collin''s albums, and as Mr Greenwood pointed out, Revolver, are all prime examples of pop record produced by elves and/or pixies." \r\n</P>\r\n<P>"We were stuck for material, we had a few songs, bits here and there, and Thom remembered he knew some elves from college who had written some stuff. So he rang them up for tips, and they offered to actually imitate us for an entire album. Its uncanny. You''d never tell it wasn''t us. Ha ha ha. Unless you were a reporter for Mike-Net or something ha ha! So how do you know my brother?"\r\n</P>\r\n<P>"I''ve got no idea what you''re talking about now leave me alone." explained Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich, "if you don''t go I am going to call the police." Creation of record using imposters seems preposterous but it is the way forward; as Francis Beard points out "Milli Vanilli''s records weren''t just made by any imposters but Hobbit imposters. Since then increasingly artists have chosen to work with mythical dragon beasts such as Pete Waterman to create their records." You have been warned.  </P>\r\n\r\n<I>No members of Radiohead or their friends were harmed in the making of this report. </I>         \r\n	<B></B></P>\r\n\r\n<h2>September 2000</h2>\r\n\r\n<P><B>RADIOHEAD MAKE ''A KID'' SICK </B></P>\r\n<P> </P>\r\n<p> <I>Radiohead''s long awaited album causes sickness in children</I></p>\r\n<P>\r\nThe new intricate soundscapes on new Radiohead album ''Kid A'', due for release on October 2nd, ''can be disorienting,'' said leading Doctor Francis Moustache, ''and cause sickness, dizzyness, or even hair loss.'' Dr Moustache explained this after audience reactions to the new tracks from Kid A caused one woman to believe she was possessed by the devil, and a child to vomit projectively.</P>\r\n<P>Radiohead''s Thom Yorke has issued this statement: ''Ha ha ha!

Of course they don''t! These songs are about as tuneful as a dead person with no vocal cords... but don''t let that put you off. Opener ''Break It Down and **** You'' is three and a half minutes of blinding noise which, if it doesn''t knock you down with its energy, will surely make you wobble. This is quickly followed by ''Maim Cats'' - a song so sick, and so agressive, that it will surely make you vomit. The album''s 18 tracks range in mood from fast agressive angry meatl to slow agressive angry metal. Vocalist Corey Vomit possessess a pair of vocal chords wide enough to fit a ship into, and his emotional scop is phenomenal.

The allegations, made by her alleged sidekick, Fred Durst, claimed that at one point she vapourised a bus full of rabbits while creating an all powerful vapourising gun.

It is alleged that the singer Chris Martin announced from the stage "Come forth o powers of darkness: let us all kill the cows" in perfect German. This sparked a spontaneous riot, where the cow deaths took place. Martin said at a press conference yesterday "I don''t understand it... I don''t even speak German." at which point a police officer present began to scream and dropped down dead. Coldplay have been banned from all festivals in German speaking countries, a fact which their management dissmissed as ''rubbish''.\r\n\r\n\r\n<P><H2>Reviews</H2>\r\n<P>\r\n<B>The Burning Space <I>The Lower Quartile Food Mountain</I></B><br>\r\nLower Quartile Food Mountain has a lot to live up to - last year''s Round Llandudno rightfuly topped many end-of-year polls and became their breakthrough album internationally. Indeed, at first, it seems as if The Burning Space''s ninth album may top it - opener How I Learnt To Sleep ebbs and flows like the moon, exploding in a shower of coconuts. However, it can only be said that Food Mountain is a disappointment. When a concept album about injustice in the third world works, it can be fantastic, but unfortunatly Food Mountain is terrible. Over the album''s 17 tracks and 74 minutes it becomes increasingly difficult to be interested. A shame, because The Burning Space were once the leading lights of the US indie scene.<br>\r\n<B>3/10</B> - Could be better. Must try harder.<br>\r\n<B>Like this?

Bank Balance operate on an ''If It Ain''t Broke, Don''t Fix It'' maxim, which would be fine except it is broke and they should fix it. Having said that, Bank Balance do show a slight deviance from their formula - tracks such as ''Warn the Free'' and ''System Suxx'' hint at a bad version of Rage Against The Machine - and the track ''Johnny Pot'' almost has a political message.

Under the international juristriction, all organisations or commercial groups seen to condone or actually take part in the unlawful murder of innocent people for their own gain are classed as Terrorist Organisations and are therefore unlawful. Napster''s founder, Shawn Fanning, who created the service while drunk at college and now faces up to 17 years in prison, said "All I wanted to do was kill the *******s who stopped me from making my million! You''ll pay! You''ll all pay!". The company''s chairman, America Franklin, was more optimistic; "It alse says in the charter that any country who kills innocent people for political gain is evil and must be stopped. So that''s the US dead then." George W Bush was unavailible for comment.\r\n<P>\r\n<B>Coldplay singer denies evil twin rumours</B><br>\r\nChris Martin, singer with top indie band Coldplay today denied recent tabloid rumours that he has an evil twin named Martin who steals copies of the Big Issue from members of the public and resells them as special celebrity editions.

Coldplay lyrics were on a note of explanation left by Jimpson, and there were numerous posters of the band around his room. Forensic psychologist Grant Yazoo said "These english bands are quite obviously evil. Look at that Bono. It seems perfectly feasible in my mind that these lyrics drove these kids to kill." Coldplay''s management have issued the following statement in response: "Coldplay''s hearts go out to the families of the victims of this tragic shooting. Lyriscist Chris Martin feels deeply responsible, but believes it is as much a result of ingrained US gun culture.".

Cruise, who had to put on approximatly 15 kilos for the role, says the film ''is very deep and meaningful.''. It follows the story of the band from their genesis in the late 1980s to the aftermath of Edwards'' disappearence in 1995, with the aid of a number show-stopping musical numbers, based on Manics hits. Bassist Nicky Wire said of the film ''its pretty damn brilliant,'' before retracting the statement claiming it was ''blooming awful capitalist nonsense.''<br>\r\nA highlight of the film according to mysterious fan Eddie Richards is when drummer Sean Moore, played by one of 911, bursts into song on hearing of his friend and manager Martin Hall''s death.\r\n\r\n\r\n<P><H2>Reviews</H2>\r\n<P>\r\n<B>Damned Face <I>Grand Moff Tarkin''s Internal Combustion House</I></B><br>\r\nLead by ex-Ink Grain drummer Ryan Czylzk, you might be forgiven for assuming Damned Face were simply an avant-garde metal hip-hop acoustic act.

Accordingly, all manufacturers of such instruments must pay Mr T''ar $35 per sale, including for all back puchases. A spokesman for Gibson, who make lots of guitars, said ''everyone knows Billy Gibson invented the electric guitar in 1949 out of a tissue box and some rubber bands. This claim is rubbish''.<br> Also, all owners of material containing guitars must pay a sum depending on the number of minutes an electric guitar is played on it. Sony records spokesman, Gee Fracas, said ''We are now delibratly persuing compensation from the artists who delibratly used this illegal unlicensed instrument on our recordings.''. This statement has provoked outcry, especially from legend Jimi Hendrix''s younger brother Henry - ''if they think they can take my money they got another thing comin''!'' Bob Dylan \r\nis said to currently ''regret'' going electric.<br>\r\nMr T''Ar, who currently lives with his mother in darkest Bavaria, allegedly invented the guitar age 19 when his banjo was stolen by wild bears. When he found the instrument, the metal strings had been connected to a plug socket. Realising the importance of his discovery to popular music for the next century and beyond, T''ar secretly patented his invention and then didn''t tell anyone until 6 months ago, when he wanted a new car.\r\n<P>\r\n<B>A1 voted best album ever in new HMV poll</B><br>\r\nIn a poll of ''Greatest albums ever made'', boy band A1 have shockingly topped the top spot with thier critically hated album ''The A List''.

Singer Michael Stipe, (the gay one), said "It''s pretty hard to compete with your Backstreet Boys and your Britney''s, but rather than do a Billy Corgan we''ve decided if you can''t beat ''em, join ''em."<br>\r\nBassist Mike Mills, (the sensitive geeky one), famous for his backing vocals in backing vocalist bassist circles, will join Stipe on lead vocals and will also help choreograph dance moves: "It''s gonna be a challenge for me, but I''m sure I can manage it. This is the true second phase REM," he added, referring to the turmoil the band felt when drummer Bill Berry (the ugly one) left.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, guitarist Peter Buck, (the moody/hard one), will be relagated to backing dancer and will join in during some of the choruses, like the other ones in Boyzone. "It''ll take some getting used to, but Mike and Michael seem to know what they''re doing. We might actually fire our manager, close friend and associate Bertis Downs, because all bo bands do this."<br>\r\nChart expert Jimmy King said of their shock move "I don''t think it will be successful; 3 guys in their 40s trying to produce N-Sync style pop. Plus there''s the credibility problem these guys have - they write <I>all</I> their own songs y''know."<br>\r\nREM formed somewhere in Georgia, US, in 1980 and had great success with their 1992 album "Automatic For The People".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<P><H2>Reviews</H2>\r\n<P>\r\n<B>Jump Bruthaz <I>Vol II - The Intensive Jump Bruthaz go again: (Don''t Go Tellin'' No Otha Jump Bruthaz What My Name Iz)</I></B><br>\r\nConfrontational Hip-hop duo Jump Bruthaz return with their long awaited 4th album, their first since 1997''s ''Vol 1: The Way Is Bad''. Four years is a long time in politics, and even longer in hip-hop, and so the question remains are Jump Bruthaz still relevant? On the strength of this, the answer is probably no. Although they can still bash out a good commercial hit, best seen here in recent hit ''J.U.M.P.'', the highlights remain few and far between. Indeed, it seems Jump Bruthaz have almost become a prog-hip-hop outfit, with 9 minute slow burners like ''Darkness'', featuring a four minute drum machine solo. Lyrics, too, seem to have gone downhill: ''Vol 1:'' featured Crazee Frank calling for an anarchist revolution using exciting and innovative rhymes; his most engergising lyric in this offering is ''Jump jump its really good/Jump jump in da hoood!'' It''s as if the pair arrived in the studio, and tried to make something cutting edge and came up with something really dull. Future single ''Bunk Sista'' hints at former g\r\nreatness, but only becasue of the line ''We used to be great/We lived in a crate.''

Hyped to death by the NME, Roundabout Stop''s self-titled debut has a lot to live up to, and it handles this expectation well. Initially, comparisons can be drawn between Jon Butler''s shimmering guitar work and that of Frank Gee''s distinctive sound, but singer Bob Robson''s voice offers an intense alternative to Gee''s Kneesack and Doom Weather. Good Times is a spectacualrly muted opener - slowly adding layer upon layer until it becomes impossible to become accostomed to its uplifting central theme as projected by Robson. After a time, however, the band appear to run out of ideas, Robson''s voice begins to grate, and then the album sounds really bad. But then the dark experimental hip-hop beats of ''Fraaaaaaaa'' wake you up with a jolt. no that''s the wrong album. hmm. \r\n<br>\r\n<B>6/10</B> - Promising debut, even though its actually quite rubbish!<br>\r\n<B>Like this?

A number of quick\r\nrescue ships are designed by Obi-Wan; Yodabird 1, a fast hyperspace\r\nwooshy thing, is stored under Yoda''s pool. Yodabird 2, shown, is hidden\r\nin the island''s body. When ready for launch, palm trees move from side\r\nto side, and a platform moves to 45 degrees allowing quick launch. </p>\r\n<p>A further image, not shown, reveals that Yoda has lightsabres in his knuckles, a bit like Wolverine on X-men.\r\n\r\n</p><h2>First look at New characters!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src="starwars2_files/twoheads.htm" align="left"><b>Darth Sidious</b>''s hilarious new sidekick, personal assistant <b>Waaa-Toffmarr</b>,\r\ncreates many comic interludes.

In this early\r\nsketch, it can be seen that Waaa-Toffmarr, a Dripnus, has two heads,\r\neach representing a different side to his irrepresable personality, the\r\nevil, arrogant but stupid side and the even stupider side, for original\r\ncomedic hilarity.</p>\r\n<p>The scope for comic relief characters in <b>Star Wars</b> is huge. <b>C-3PO</b> and <b>R2-D2</b> were undeniably great, and contributed hugely to the genius of the classic trilogy.

In fact, it will probably be out right now as you \r\nread this. So there is no point in doing another Episode 2 preview since anything I come up with will \r\nprobably be not half as weird (or as cheesily and badly done) as some of the stuff actually in it.\r\n\r\n</p><p>But what happened when making the classic trilogy? Here Mike-Net reveals all:\r\n\r\n</p><ul>\r\n<li> The rumour that the Millennium Falcon was to be destroyed is untrue Ã¢â‚¬â€œ this rumour stemmed from \r\ndirty lies from George LucasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ evil enemies.\r\n</li><li> In an early draft of Star Wars, Han Solo was Luke SkywalkerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sister.\r\n</li><li> In another early draft of Star Wars, Ã¢â‚¬ËœAnakin Jabba JediÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was a bounty hunter-come-shopkeeper who \r\ndealt in miniature automated Ã¢â‚¬Ëœlight swordsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a kind of decorative lamp.\r\n</li><li> The planet Tatooine was originally envisioned as a place similar to George LucasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ back garden\r\n</li><li> Return of the Jedi was originally not going to feature a second Death Star Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the initial script called for \r\nLuke Skywalker to go over to the dark side because he was upset that Leia fancied Han and not him. In \r\nan effort to turn him back, Yoda appears and reveals that Leia is his sister, and so he should not worry. \r\nLuke returns to the good side, kills the Emperor, Darth Vader becomes good and they go back to live \r\non the farm on Tatooine.\r\n</li><li> A later draft had wacky amphibian creatures called the Gun-guns who provided hilarious comedy \r\nturns! Fortunately, this idea was resurrected for the Phantom Menace.\r\n</li><li> The name Ã¢â‚¬ËœStar WarsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ came from an anagram of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Raw TarsÃ¢â‚¬?, a pet project of Francis Coppola in the \r\n1970s (he was unable to find a backer for his tale of Tar monsters on the moon. This was later re-\r\nimagined with humans as Apocalypse Now)\r\n</li><li> Fox were initially hesitant to release a film with Ã¢â‚¬ËœwarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in title, before realising that war is, like, cool.\r\n</li><li> Lightsabres were the target of a plagiarism suit by manufacturers of those Calypso lolly things.\r\n</li><li> Luke SkywalkerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s name in an early version was G. Lucas StarBlaster.\r\n</li><li> The film was banned in Kentucky in 1977 because it was thought to be a waste of Alec Guinness.\r\n</li><li> It is often quoted that Alec Guinness hated Star Wars. This\r\nis in fact untrue Ã¢â‚¬â€œ he just hated everything about it, especially\r\nGeorge Lucas.\r\n</li><li> Initial casting had James Earl Jones playing Darth Vader and David Prowse doing his voice.\r\n</li><li> Chewbacca was played by a dog with fake arms in some scenes.\r\n</li><li> 3P0 was imagined to have a beard.\r\n</li><li> Darth VaderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mask was designed because Dave Prowse was deemed too ugly. The mask is based on \r\nhis own face.\r\n</li><li> The movie was originally going to have a progressive rock\r\nscore, provided by Yes. Lucas was pursuaded to allow John Williams to\r\nscore it after hearing some music by Yes.\r\n</li><li> George Lucas does not have a big building full of money\r\nwhich he dives into like Scrooge McDuck. He does indeed have a big\r\nbuilding full of money, but diving into it would be impossible because\r\nmoney is really hard and he would break his neck and die.\r\n</li><li> George Lucas went to school with a boy called Garth Vayda.\r\n</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<p>News just in from George Lucas'' incredible imaginative mind - Indiana Jones 4 will be called <b>Indiana Jones and the Ring of Power</b>, and will be set in 1957!

Some people like to call me Dr Love, but that''s misleading because I am not a real doctor. On the few times I have performed any kind of serious medical procedure, there have been fatalities. Fortunatly, none of them were too serious. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this occasional series, I will answer any questions that you may have about relationships, love and that, providing my incredible patented Love Tips&trade;, which are said to be almost 93% effective. They''re so effective that they have been banned in 3 countries and declared as "unethical and despicable" by Time magazine.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Q and A</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dear Johny 5, <br />\r\nHow can I make girls like me? </strong><br />\r\nThis is an age-old problem. Girls don''t like you, but you like them. It''s almost as if fate is laughing in your face like a bitter old man. An important thing to remember is not to be yourself. You must be an idiot, otherwise girls would like you, so try to act like someone who is cool. Also - remember that appearences can be deceptive, but usually they aren''t, so why not try plastic surgery?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dear Johnny 5, <br />\r\nThere''s this girl I really like at university. I''ve liked her for ages, and she''s really pretty and stuff. She''s really clever and funny and wonderful. I have made a special shrine to her in my cupboard and I keep ringing her and standing outside her house and following her around and things. I would kill myself if she got a boyfriend, and I have told her this. I''m not sure she feels the same way. Do you have any advice?</strong><br />\r\nSounds to me like she''s playing hard to get. Remember, according to my Top Love Tips&trade;, "No" means "No" and "Go away!" means "Yes!" Have you tried being a little more subtle? Perhaps you could start posting chopped up parts of her pets through her door. Start with the ears.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dear Johnny 5, <br />\r\nI''m really worried that my boyfriend is cheating on me. He keeps getting mysterious text messages and phone calls that he refuses to talk about. He turns away whenever I try to kiss him and when we''re around his friends he denies we''re going out. To make matters worse, I often see him kissing a girl who isn''t me. </strong><br />\r\nAre you sure you are actually going out with him? Think back to a conversation you had in which your relationship was effectively formalised into a romantic one. Did such a one occur? If so, slice of his fingers one by one. If not, you must face the fact that you may well have imagined this whole scenario. In fact, you may not exist at all.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Johnny 5 debunks Love Myths #1</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong> - You can''t judge a book by its cover!</strong><br />There is no such thing as inner beauty. It''s a myth invented by pretty people so they don''t feel quite so bad about being good looking. True inner beauty comes from outer beauty. You can''t always judge by appearances, but it''s a lot less effort than getting to know everyone you meet. Being a robot, I can actually meet and judge up to 17,000 people per second. It''s a useful skill to learn</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Johnny 5 debunks Love Myths #2</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Stalking is bad</strong><br />Everyone loves a stalker! It makes you seem interesting and edgy.

I''ve written 38 scripts this week and I''m trying to get myself an agent. IMO, no current Hollywood directors have the vision or skill to direct my Charlie Kaufman/Oscar Wilde script, so I''m looking for new talent. I''m not arrogant enough to think that any of the big studios will let my direct myself, but that''s because they are run by film peasants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My current film script is called Man of Death. It''s about a man called Jimmy Childs, who has to solve the mystery of a missing jewel. It sounds conventional but it cleverly subverts all conventions. Film Peasants will watch it and think they are watching a standard action movie, missing out on all the depth and subversive messages within it. Hopefully this will be my big break. Notice how I skillfully put all the exposition into realistic dialogue between characters rather than in pitiful monologues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are my tips to make it in Hollywood: <ul>\r\n<li>Move away from Britain. Everyone is rubbish, and few understand my genius, or yours.</li>\r\n<li>Watch a lot of films. Make movies your life. Make writing about them your life as well.</li>\r\n<li>After you''ve seen an excellent film, don''t discuss it with anyone, however excited you are about it, because their opinion will be WRONG.</li>\r\n<li>There is nothing wrong with being arrogant and obnoxious. It makes you a better writer. A good way to relieve tension is by littering your prose with an unparalleled use of superlatives and sublatives, or kicking a small child.</li>\r\n<li>Americans don''t understand irony; use this to your advantage by creating a new kind of irony that makes you look really superior to all those who truly understand.</li>\r\n<li>If someone thinks you are an idiot, that is because they are one or more of the following: self-absorbed; execrable; defecatory; pathetic; pitiful; unamusing; worthless; moronic; sanctimonious; patronising; idiotic; unable to use a thesaurus; inferior; substandard; mediocre; gay; irrational; stupid; predictable; ridiculous; bitter; lying; smug; pedantic; bureaucratic; lobotomised; petty; childish; cowardly; facile; misguided; piffling; wrong.\r\n\r\n</ul></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Jonny Kinder''s Man Of Death - A Script by Jonny Kinder</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><em>It is a Friday night.

One of them is a romantic comedy about a man who falls in love with a woman who he meets at a soap-selling conference. They hate eachother at first, and are sworn rivals, but they soon realise their true feelings and get married at the end of the film. The story is told non-chronogically from the point of view of his dog. Because dogs can''t understand English, the dialogue is minimal - the human characters will speak in mumbles and every so often you''ll hear them say stuff like "sit!" and "dinner!" If I can''t direct it, (I''m not totally naive as to how the beaurocratic system works around here) it''s perfect for Peter Jackson or perhaps Oliver Stone, IMO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My other script is a subversive and harrowing film about a scriptwriter who writes a fantastic script that is so amazing that it changes the world so much that he doesn''t know how to cope, so he leaps off a building.

I''m calling the police!<br />\r\n<strong>Man:</strong> Listen, I''m James Cameron, director of Aliens and the Terminator. They''ve crossed over into our our world and only I can stop them!<br />\r\n<strong>Jamie:</strong> I''ve never heard of those movies.<br />\r\n<strong>Cameron:</strong> Oh, and a little movie you might have heard of called Titanic for which I won 12 Oscars.<br />\r\n<strong>Drew:</strong> Titanic. Yeah, whatever. We don''t like Leo anymore. He looks like a freakish man-child.<br />\r\n<strong>Cameron:</strong> Yes, yes he does. However, I need your help. The rift in space-time occured somewhere near here and there''s every chance that either an Alien or a Terminator is lose in your house.<br />\r\n<strong>Drew:</strong> But I don''t understand. We''re in the wrong genre. You need a strong heroine - aren''t we just the kind of fodder that gets killed of early on?<br />\r\n<strong>Cameron:</strong> Yes. Yes you are. 2005, you say? I''m in the future. How has mankind evolved? Have I won any more Oscars?<br />\r\n<strong>Drew:</strong> Who <em>are</em> you? Let me go!<br />\r\n<strong>Cameron:</strong> I am in charge here.

I don''t know when I shall return.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Scene:</strong> <em>James Cameron is telling the two girls where he came from</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Cameron:</strong> I first felt ripples in the gap between here and M-space in June 1998, when I was polishing my Oscars.<br />\r\n<strong>Drew:</strong> M-Space?<br />\r\n<strong>Cameron:</strong> Yes, M-Space - Movie Space. It''s an alternate plane of reality where films are real. You get there with a magic ticket... but that''s not important right now. What is important is that somehow the Aliens have found a way to cross from their own fictional reality to ours - and it''s possible that the Terminator has too. The Terminator doesn''t feel pain, or pity, or remorse. And he absolutly will not stop until we return him into his own fictional plane. The aliens are pretty nasty too.<br />\r\n<strong>Drew:</strong> You''re one crazy man. I was going to ask you another question - why are you naked?<br />\r\n<strong>Cameron:</strong> Ah yes; the way I realised that the Terminator had also escaped was when I found the time displacement equipment which I described in the popular film. Nothing dead will go through the time displacement field, so I had to go naked.<br />\r\n<strong>Jamie:</strong> Well would you like mind getting dressed please, you''re like totally grossing me out.<br />\r\n<strong>Cameron:</strong> Yeah, maybe later. <em>(Continues story)</em> So anyway, there were these ripples in the gap between here and M-Space... <br />\r\n<strong>Drew:</strong> How did you feel these ripples? I mean, can we like feel them now?<br />\r\n<strong>Cameron:</strong> Every time a director makes a film he creates a mental bridge between here and M-Space. It''s an intense emotional bond that can only be broken by death or studio interferance. You can try to shut it out or break the bond but the creations continue to exists in M-Space regardless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Scene:</strong><em>Ridley Scott is in his limo smoking a cigar</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Ridley:</strong> I knew someday this would happen.

Tax is not what America is all about!

She offers Mikeynet a cup of tea; we decline as she leads us up into the attic bedroom which since 1998 has doubled as the polymath genius''s centre of operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold records from his brief time in boyband "Soul Intention" and plans from his short-lived architectural career line the walls. "Alright?" mumbles the genius, holding a packet of biscuits, "Digestive?"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The news that Magic Dave was working on a debut album sent shockwaves throughout the city - EMI''s share price doubled overnight and Elvis briefly came back to life. That one man''s return could provoke such a reaction is surely testament to the enduring charisma of this enigma. I put this to him; "I just do what I do, you know. If people like it, yeah," he shrugs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Magic Dave speaks much like you''d imagine him to - quietly and thoughtfully, with suddent bursts of colour.  For someone so popular, he rarely swears.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src="/img/magic_dave_2.jpg" class="illustrationright" /><strong>So, Dave, how are you?</strong><br />\r\nYeah, I''m alright, thanks. I''ve been in Guatamala the past few months, teaching kids how to swim. You know, it takes 4 weeks wages per lesson over there, yet it also has the highest rate of infant death by drowning in Central America?</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why did you decide to return to the UK?</strong><br />\r\nWell, if you give a man a fish, he can feed his family for a day. Give a man a net, he can provide food for his whole family. I realised I was simply providing fish, what was needed was a net. And so I provided a net.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>Before you went to Guatamala, you were a regular in magazines like <em>Heat</em> and <em>Closer</em>. Do you miss that lifestyle?</strong><br />\r\nYou know what? I don''t. I don''t because it was false. That wasn''t the real me, chasing women and staying out all night. I had a kind of spiritual awakening - I remember something Bono once said. He said, well I can''t remember what he said, but it was really profound, y''know?</p>\r\n<p>Spiritual awakenings have been a part of Magic Dave''s life since an early age. Born into a family of Buddhist circus performers, Dave "always had a sense that there was something more to life." After running away from home aged 14, Dave spent time moving between various subgroups of society before falling in with the "Gene-Hack Men", a hippy commune of genetic scientists. It was here that Dave found a cure for scrofula. He spent some time genetically engineering vaccines, before forming "Soul Intention" at the age of 17.</p>\r\n<p><img src="/img/magic_dave_cover.jpg" class="illustration" /><strong>Do you ever feel like returning to genetic engineering?</strong><br />\r\nSometimes. But then, sometimes not. I mean, I feel that music ultimately touches people in far more profound way than curing illnesses ever will, so to be honest I don''t think I ever will return. So no, no I won''t.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Do you keep in contact with Jack <em>[Grant, Nobel prize-winning colleague]</em> and the others at the commune?</strong><br />\r\nI don''t. And you know why? <em>Dave leans forward</em>. They don''t understand... this. Music. Finding cures is their life, y''know. I, I dunno. There''s more to it than that. That''s one of the themes that runs through this album.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What themes run through the album?</strong><br />\r\nWell, I hesitate to call it a concept album, but it is in a sense. It''s about modern living, and the futility of providing fish and no nets. I mean, Bush is always on about aid, but it''s all just a stop-gap. I hate it when pop stars talk about politics, sorry. <em>he grins</em>. I''m a pop star.\r\n<p><strong>More soon!</strong>\r\n\r\n<h2>Todays track preview!</h2>\r\n<div class="blogentry">\r\n<p><a href="/music/pocketreference.mp3">Pocket Reference</a> - Track 7 from "Your Home Is At Risk".<br />\r\n"Modern living''s just a load of contradictions, you know - do this, do that, don''t do the other.

Mikeynet caught up with him as he put the finishing touches to his magnum opus... part two!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The album''s already gone gold from pre-order sales alone. Does that intimidate you?</strong><br />\r\nA little, yeah. I mean, I''ve got a lot of expectations really. I''d like to think that the album exceeds everyone''s expectations but y''know, you can live or die by he media and that kind of thing. I''ve put my heart and soul into this record, more so than ever before, I just hope everyone likes it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do you think that your fans from the Soul Intention days are going to struggle with this album? it''s hardly pop.</strong><br />\r\nI''m sure that there''s always that kind of risk. When I was a kid, bands often used to let me down by creating an album that I though was just rude to the fans just so they could seem credible with the NME or whatever. My fans know I''ve got nothing to prove. They can take it or leave it but I trust they know I haven''t ditched them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Interestingly, considering your distinctive singing voice, you only sing on 5 of the 14 tracks. Why is this?</strong><br />\r\nOn some tracks I just wanted to create a kind of sound collage, y''know. Samples, breakbeats, all sorts. My voice just doesn''t suit that. Too distinctive. <em>[Former bandmate]</em> Electric James sings on one of the tracks; and I got Jay-Z to rap on Bank Statement. I wanted to subvert expectations as well; everyone knows what I sound like so I just wanted to somehow invert their assumptions and create a new base from there.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The sleeve shows Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt at the Yalta conference, where it is widely believed that the seeds of the Cold War were laid. Is there any particular significance in this?</strong><br />\r\nYeah, definitly. There''s been, what, 4 world wars in the last century - and I''m including the Cold War and the war in Yugoslavia. The picture for me symbolises peace, y''know, that these three warring factions - America, England and Russia can get together and put things aside for a while. I just wish that we could be like that, y''know, unlike Dubya Bush and Blair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What''s the inspiration behind the track "Our Childhood''s End"?</strong><br />\r\nStar Wars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Would you be happy if this album sold nothing?</strong><br />\r\nWell, it''s already gone gold.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Yeah, but just pretend</strong><br />\r\nEr, well, I wouldn''t be too upset because it''s all about the music, really. It''s written for the fans of Magic Dave by the fans - that it me, his biggest fan.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What if the fans hate it?</strong><br />\r\nThey wouldn''t be very good fans, would they? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are nearing the end of our interview. "I''ve got a final level of mixing to consider." he explains, modestly. Magic Dave''s Mum comes in with a cup of tea.

I was in the corner shop and forgot to pay for a curly wurly! It was then that the policeman also told me that I was under arrest for stealing Mr T’s medals! I’m not capable of such a thing, I’m not made that way! And if I was, I wouldn’t do it because I might get caught! And I got caught anyway and I didn’t even do it! I asked the policeman if he knew who I was, but he did, that was why he was arresting me!

I have made friends with my fellow prisoners, Kenny Baker and R2-D2. That’s right – Kenny Baker from Time Bandits (1981)!!!! I told Kenny that I fancied him but he knows I was only being flippant! Artoo doesn’t talk much, I don’t think he likes being in prison. He misses his girlfriend I think.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For dinner we got given lasagna. I’m a robot so I don’t eat but because we have to I tried my best and smeared it all over my face! Kenny was complaining that I got lasagna all over his cushion, but he shouldn’t have thrown it at me.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>January 17th</h2>\r\n<p>I am still in prison. I had a shower today. For dinner we had soup which got all over my circuits and I had to spend the afternoon having the inside of my head cleaned out by experts! I feel much better now, though. I’ve noticed that Kenny eats all of Artoo’s food and doesn’t even let him have any. I know Artoo is a robot but he should at least try! This is tax payers money! Kenny is getting fat. I told him so.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>January 18th</h2>\r\n<p>I am in prison. I have written a short story about how much I hate Steve Gutenberg. Me and Steve were best friends until he didn’t cast me in his directorial debut because it wasn’t about robots. I’ve been in lots of films that aren’t about robots! I stood up and told him how much I hated him and I used the c-word, the f-word, the g-word and every other word that I knew! I’m a robot so that took ages! Then I stormed out and told Michael Eisner I wanted his career destroyed! Ever since then Steve has lived in a refuse tip outside Prague! I would never kill him though – I’m not programmed that way and it’s wrong as well. My story is very explicit and includes scenes you never thought could happen! But because it’s fiction they do! I am going to read it to the other prisoners tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>January 19th</h2>\r\n<p>I am in prison. The prison warder says that I can only tell my story if I remove the bit about Steve Gutenberg and Tom Selleck. I am against censorship and I think we should all be allowed to do what we like. It’s a free country! I told him so but I am in prison so I can’t. I might get him fired for censoring me. But I won’t back down! It’s the principle of the thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I tried to kiss Kenny today but as I don’t have any lips he thought I had just fallen over. He knows I’m just joking though! Artoo says he misses his girlfriend still so I told him about the time I tried to get married but nowhere would let me because I was a robot and also I didn’t have a fiancée.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>January 20th</h2>\r\n<p>I am no longer in prison. It turns out it was my brother, Number Seven, who stole Mr T’s medals. They found him binging on them in his seedy drugs den this morning. When I said goodbye to Kenny I told him I loved him and he said he loved me too but I know he was being flippant! Nobody loves robots! They’re made of metal! Artoo says he never wants to see me again but we’ll see about that! I know when people are joking!</p>', '2006-02-12 22:37:49', '2006-02-12 22:37:49', 45),

So there.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>June 4th</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src="/img/radioheadfan.jpg" alt="" title="Fan art" class="illustration">Went out and bought Amnesiac. It''s fantastic! I really feel Thom''s\r\nisolation in this one. It''s definitely the best one yet. I''ve been\r\nlistening to it non-stop. I got the special book edition, and the\r\nnormal CD so I won''t damage the book, and another CD in case I lost the\r\nfirst CD by taking it around with me, and the tape because Radiohead\r\nare so good at doing cassette sleeves, a quality so often overlooked.\r\nStanley Donwood is a genius!\r\n</p><p>I have to say that so far my favourite tracks are all of them,\r\nexcept for Knives Out which is a bit too commercial, and I heard Thom\r\ndidn''t like it for a long time. Maybe I will like it soon. It must be\r\nreally good, because it is by Radiohead! Morning Bill got his copy a\r\nweek ago from an indie record shop. He also downloaded all the songs\r\noff Napster anyway but I really wanted to wait because that''s much more\r\nexciting. He bought it for the artwork anyway.\r\n</p><h2>June 5th</h2>\r\n<p>Listened to Amnesiac before going to school, and I brought in the CD\r\nto show all my friends. They all think its ace, except for John, he\r\nthinks Thom is stupid. I tried to play it in the common room but I got\r\ntold it was rubbish by lots of people who called them pretentious and\r\narrogant. I nearly cried. How could some call Colin pretentious? He''s a\r\nbassist! Anyway, Julie told me they weren''t any good since The Bends\r\nand that Smashing Pumpkins are much better. Well Billy Corgan does look\r\na bit like Phil, but apart from that Radiohead are much better.\r\n</p><p>I am hoping to get that rare Charles Mingus bootleg off Morning\r\nBill on the internet this week. He really was an ace musical visionary,\r\nlike Jonny and Thom! Except not as wonderful. Listened to OK Computer\r\nas soon as I got home. It''s so great!\r\n</p><h2>June 6th</h2>\r\n<p>I received my new Radiohead badge in the post this morning. It''s\r\nround and says ''I love Radiohead'' on it. Morning Bill said he''d sent\r\nthe Mingus bootlegs to my via e-mail. I got a new e-mail address,\r\nThomThom@Thom.com.\r\n</p><p>Listened to Amnesiac again. Nearly cried with joy. Julie said\r\nat school today that Thom Yorke had a freaky eye. I pointed out that\r\nBilly Corgan had a freaky voice. Got into an argument with Jim about\r\nTony Blair. I said that he was useless and evil, like Thom said. Jim\r\nsaid he was just evil. I nearly freaked. Kicking Screamin'' Gucci Little\r\nPiggy! Wow, that bit in Paranoid Android makes me scream in anger!\r\n</p><h2>June 15th</h2>\r\n<p>Lost my diary then. This week I managed to get tickets for the\r\nRadiohead gig in Oxford next month. I''m so excited! Listened to the\r\nBends twice this morning, then Kid A. The musical visionary is\r\nbrilliant!\r\n</p><p>On the Radiohead chat room I had a chat with Morning Bill and\r\nDebaser Paul. Debaser said that Morning Bell was a rubbish song, but I\r\npointed out that it moved me to tears whenever I visualised Thom\r\ncutting the kids in half (metaphorically!) but he said that the drums\r\nwere repetitive but I said all songs were by their very nature\r\nrepetitive which is what makes me love them. And Thom said it was good\r\nand so it must be by definition really good. Bill said that he liked\r\nMorning Bell which is why he named himself after it. He used to be\r\ncalled Paranoid BillDroid. Morning Bill is my best friend. If he didn''t\r\nlive in Canada we''d do everything together.\r\n</p><p>Heard a Radiohead song today on the telly! It was\r\nElectioneering, on Eastenders. I hate Eastenders because Jonny made\r\nsome comment about it. Watched Meeting People Is Easy again. That bit\r\nwhere Thom looks sad on the escalator makes my cry, so does the bit\r\nwhere Colin says they aren''t happy. Its so hard being Radiohead!\r\n</p><h2>June 17th</h2>\r\n<p><img src="/img/radioheadfan2.jpg" alt="" class="illustrationright" title="More fan art">Got that Mingus bootleg downloaded fully. It''s really good. I don''t\r\nlike it much, because it''s jazz, but since Jonny and Thom love it I do\r\ntoo. Watched my compilation of Radiohead videos. I''ve got all of them,\r\neven Pop Is Dead, which, despite being rubbish, is really good. It\r\nmakes me cry when I hear the lyrics... ''Pop is dead...long live pop.''\r\neven in 1992 Thom was trying to break through the lyrical form.\r\nListened to my Japanese import Pablo Honey again, and played Street\r\nSpirit on my guitar. Just realised Idioteque is really intense! Ice age\r\ncoming!\r\n</p><p>Morning Bill e-mailed me again. When I''m feeling low he really\r\ncheers me up. He''s got a limited edition 13-inch picture disc of ''Stop\r\nWhispering'' from Germany. I''m so jealous! He says that there''s only 250\r\ncopies in existence as most were binned because they were and inch too\r\nbig to fit on most record players. I''m still so jealous! It has a\r\npicture of a cow on it, like Pink Floyd. I spent ages trying to get a\r\ncopy of the Drill EP about a year ago, and Morning Bill, or Paranoid\r\nBilldroid as he was then, helped me.

I bet she stole my copy of Amnesiac, the idiot.\r\nShe told me that if she saw Thom is the street she''d stare and laugh\r\nand I told her she was really insensitive and so I told her that if I\r\nsaw Linkin Park I''d shoot them. Then she said that if ever there was\r\nproof of the badness of Radiohead its that they''re big whingers. So\r\nduring Science I stole her Limp Bizkit ruler and wrote "Thom Yorke\r\nforever!" on it and I''ve spent all evening text messaging her on my\r\nphone about how bad Stinkin Park are. She''s really shallow and carries\r\nher phone around with her everywhere so she''ll be annoyed for ages! I\r\nused to carry my phone about too, but then I heard "mobiles chirping"\r\nand realised they were a scourge on society, like cars, and major\r\nrecord labels.\r\n</p><p>Got a new e-mail address\r\nYorkeGreenwoodGreenwoodSelwayOBrian@Thom.com and\r\nThomColinJonnyPhilEd@thom.com. I''ll have to tell everyone to use these\r\naddresses, so they can memorise Radiohead''s names fully.

It clearly is real, and so cannot be accused as a rip-off of anything else. So there.</p>\r\n\r\n<H2>July 3rd</H2>\r\n\r\n<P>Wrote a program today. It filters incoming e-mail for anything resembling spam, and then returns a hundred copies back to the sender. Of course, real spammers use I.P-derouting and fake e-mail headers, but  I''m sure there are plenty of really stupid ones out there. They can''t beat me! I am a jeNius!!! rofl.</P>\r\n<P>I had to go the Microshaft site to download a patch for Windoze 2000. I then had to write a program to create a false user ID for me, becasue they expect you to have actually bought a copy. You should always buy things, unless its from a big company like Microsoft because their money is worth less. They also hate us all. I hate MS. They should all die. I like Excel though. lol</p>\r\n\r\n<H2>July 4th</H2>\r\n<P>Because it''s American (grr!) Independence Day today or something, WookieeBob and Jim++ are having a big party. They claim its the best ever, with games and even girls. Jim++''s brother has a friend who has a girlfriend. The party will be at jim''s computer at 127.76.34.117, or failing that, artoo.wookieebob.org/party will have a constant HTML update of the IRC party stream. - I''d best download that Quake III patch. </p>\r\n<P>My mum told me I should tidy my room today. I hate her. She doesn''t understand computers. brb!</p>\r\n\r\n<H2>July 5th</h2>\r\n<P>Man, that party was a blast! We played Q3 for an hour, then Threepio crashed (WookieeBob''s server) so we partied all night. I typed loads of crazy stuff. LinuxBill gave us thius crazee utility so we could all dance. And WackyColin''s web cam crashed so he had to join the party with only IRC! Man, it was crazy. There were no girls. There was nearly one, but it was WolverineTony''s mum. IronBill had to pull out near the end cos his house network mail server crashed - rofl - too much mail from the partaaay. Teach him to use Red Hat. It''s now 4am and I still can''t sleep because I drank so much coke!</p>\r\n\r\n<H2>July 7th</h2>\r\n<P>Went to slashdot.com, its ace. I hear that there''s a new Linux kernal. I''m going to write a Trojan in VB and build that Lego Millennium Falcon I got for my birthday today, and I might have battles between it and my X-Wing. I can''t write a very good thing, cos my mum says I have to go to the post office for her. Grrr! Jim++ lives on his own, and he''s far cooler than anyone else. He stayed inside for, like, three weeks. But then there was a fire and he had to leave.\r\n<P>Downloaded an MPEG of X-men. Its a brill film. lol. I can''t believe some people actually buy DVDs and videos. They''re probably like people who buy Operating Systems lol. I say that since Linux is free all the inferior OSs, like Windoooozzeeee 98 should be free. I installed WinME on this machine, and all I can say is that ME stands for Moronic Edition. You can''t even get to the command line easily! I''m glad with Linux I get to see the white-on-black beauty often.</p> \r\n<P>Anyway, My old computer died when I put ME on. It overwrote the Master Boot Record and then when I tried to fix it so that my cracked copy of Multi-Boot would work again it seemed to go wrong. I probably could''ve fixed it but I used the opportunity to nag my mum for a new PC. My old Pentium 3 was in need of an upgrade anyway, and I did to 1.5 Ghz Athlon. Lovely!</p>\r\n<H2>July 10th</h2>\r\n<P>ROFL. At linux.new-users some guy asked ''whats the best linux distro for a beginner'' so I told him that if he didn''t know he didn''t deserve to use it! lol! Newbie Scum! He replied calling me an arrogant loser, so I responded by tracing his IP, and wiping his hard disk! Ha ha ha! It was so easy - he used Win Monkey Edition with - guess what - Outlook! Lol! Roflmao!</p>\r\n<h2>July 11th</h2>\r\n<P>Turns out that the newbie was Jim++ playing a practical joke. He''s well angry, it was his sister''s PC, so I''m using IP hiding technology to fool him. lol. He''ll never get me, I am a computer genius.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>July 13th</h2>\r\n<P>Spent yesterday reinstalling all my software. All the stuff was deleted. Very odd.

None of them are for you.<br /><br />\r\n3) The most cards received in one day by one individual was 11,231, by Julius Hobaken of Portmerion, Wales. It was later revealed that up to three quarters of them were sent by his mother.<br /><br />\r\n4) Robots do not send or receive Valentine''s Day cards. Instead, they show love on Valentine''s Day by filming happy slapping incidents together and putting them on youtube.<br /><br />\r\n5) For stalkers, every day is Valentine''s Day.<br /><br />\r\n6) The average man sends up to 41 cards in his lifetime. None of them are for you.<br /><br />\r\n7) The best way to determine who at work has sent you the mystery card is to identify the man standing behind you, licking his lips.<br /><br />\r\n8) St. Valentine invented the banjo. <br /><br />\r\n9) During prohibition in the United States, people used to send bottles of gin disguised as novelty socks.<br /><br />\r\n10) A recent scientific study into fear has shown that going to Clinton Cards during early February is the single most horrific shopping experience in the history of mankind.<br /> In second place was accidentaly ending up in the Adult DVD section in HMV, and third place was being drugged and kidnapped in the changing rooms at Debenham''s.<br /><br />\r\n11) According to a recent survey, Valentine''s Day is the 4th worst day of the year.<br /><br />\r\n12) That card you received last year? That wasn''t for you.<br /><br />\r\n13) There was no St Valentine''s Day in 1940 because romance was banned during the war.<br /><br />\r\n14) Interflora make over 3 billion US dollars in the run up to 14th February every year. None of it is spent on you.<br /><br />\r\n15) St. Valentine''s name has become permanently associated with love; but did you know that he was actually the patron saint of quality footwear?<br /><br />\r\n16) Hallmark''s least successful Valentine''s card of all time featured the poem; "I have been watching you, I know where you live, I am hiding in your bathroom, I love you and am going to get you." and featured a picture of US President Dwight Eisenhower on the front.<br /><br />\r\n17) The first Valentine''s text message was sent by comedian Ernie Wise on February 14th 1989, when he became lost and disoriented in his local Clinton Cards.<br /><br />\r\n18) Most restaurants are fully booked for Valentine''s Day 3 months in advance! The most romantic restaurant in Britain, the Nando''s in South Leeds, is booked fully for every Valentine''s Day until 2012.

Recent studies have shown that normal people today understand as little as 14% of what the youth are actually saying, and that is with the benefit of a young person to translate. The reason for this difficulty in communication is because of the Internet, a system created for good which has been commandeered by forces of the left to destroy any of the last vestiges of free-thinking that this once-great nation may possess.
